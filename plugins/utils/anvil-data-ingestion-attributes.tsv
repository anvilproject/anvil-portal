The specific aims are: 1) To determine the population-based epidemiologic profile (allele frequency, main effect, heterogeneity by disease characteristics) of putative causal variants in the five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC; 2) for variants displaying effect heterogeneity across ethnic/racial groups, we will utilize differences in LD to identify a more complete spectrum of associated variants at these loci; 3) investigate gene x gene and gene x environment interactions to identify modifiers; 4) examine the associations of putative causal variants with already measured intermediate phenotypes (e.g., plasma insulin, lipids, steroid hormones); and 5) for variants that do not fall within known genes, start to investigate their relationships with gene expression and epigenetic patterns in small genomic studies. dbGaP study ID: phs000220.

To overcome these barriers, investigators from seven major IBD centers formed the Sinai Helmsley Alliance for Research Excellence (SHARE) in 2010 to integrate information from basic science, epidemiology and information sciences to advance IBD research across multiple high-volume centers. The consortium provides a unique opportunity to examine between-center practice variation in the management of CD and UC, a particularly pertinent question in view of significant recent changes in the treatment paradigms. dbGaP study registration in progress.

A total of 2,000 women who are 18 - 55 years of age and a smaller comparison group of 1,000 similarly aged men will be enrolled in this multi-site observational study from approximately 120 different hospitals across the country. Young women have a much greater risk of dying after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than similarly aged men. Their mortality risk is markedly higher than that of young men, and limited data on young minority women suggest that they may have the highest risk of any young subgroup. Findings from the small number of published studies of young women with ischemic heart disease suggest that the biology, epidemiology, care, and outcomes of this group are distinct from those of men. To date, there have been no large studies of this population, even as the death toll is comparable to that from breast cancer in this...

Understanding how best to design rare variant studies for common disease. Developing resources, informatics tools, and innovative approaches and technologies for multiple disease research communities and the wider biomedical research community.

The goal of the study is to recruit 20,000 cases and 20,000 controls of Pakistani descent. Eligible cases were individuals aged 30-80 who presented to the emergency department of a participating recruitment center in Pakistan with clinical symptoms consistent with a myocardial infarction (MI), ECG changes consistent with MI, elevated troponin levels consistent with MI, and no prior history of cardiovascular disease. Controls were individuals of Pakistani descent who did not have a self-reported history of cardiovascular disease. This site hosts data from ~1,200 whole genomes and ~9,700 whole exomes (50% cases and 50% controls).

As the CCDG has focused initially on non-Caucasian populations for whole genome sequencing, T1DGC participants of African, Mexican and Asian ancestry (targeting ~1200 cases and ~1200 controls in each ancestral group) and a small group of participants of Northern European ancestry (~100 cases, ~100 controls) were to be contributed to the study.

The largest publicly available collection of iPSCS has been generated from 2,500 donors by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). This dataset contains 30x whole genome sequence data from a selection of CIRM iPSC donors. These data can be used to identify candidate lines for experiments with specific genotypes of interest and lines from donors with high or low polygenic risk scores for phenotypes of interest. The data can also be used to identify acquired mutations in the iPSC lines.

As a model cellular phenotype we analyzed genetic influences on expression of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, which is encoded by the paralogous SMN1 and SMN2 genes. Deficiency of SMN, an RNA-binding protein, results in widespread splicing defects and causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Human fibroblasts from SMA patients were obtained from the Columbia University Biobank and reprogrammed at Harvard. This workspace contains 30x whole genome sequence data from one SMA patient.
