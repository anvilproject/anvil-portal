# Data Access Controls

<hero small>AnVIL provides robust access controls that can selectively grant access to a number of groups with different access request requirements.</hero


## Access Groups


**Consortium Members** - Members of the data-generating consortium are granted access directly by a designated official of the consortium. Guidelines for this official are being drafted by the Data Access Working Group and will be made available when they are finalized

**[External Researcher Access](/data/requesting-data-access)** - Members of the wider community may request access through dbGAP. Upon receiving access in dbGAP, the researcher will be able to access the data within AnVIL.
 

## Specifications
Terra maintains access controls through a list of Authorization Groups (Auth Groups) attached to each workspace. If a workspace has an auth group attached, it can only be interacted with by users inside the group.
 
 Auth groups can also contain other groups, allowing a simple nesting structure to make additions and removals simple. How each group above gets their names onto an auth group varies per user list. 

In general, a top level auth group is created for the workspace with the data, and each of the user lists is added as a secondary group - populated according to the parameters for those users.

1. **Consortium Members** - As a dataset is onboarded, a point of contact is identified to serve as the point of contact for consortium access. This person is granted administrative rights over an auth group. Consortium members are added and removed from this list periodically to match the consortiumâ€™s membership records and maintain the integrity of the list.

1. **External Researchers** - dbGAP deposits a copy of their whitelist to a secure ftp site. This list is read by Terra and synced to an internal auth group. It is maintained entirely and solely by dbGAP beyond the initial linking to a new workspace.



## Monitoring and Logging

Both Terra and Gen3 operate in a FISMA-Moderate environment and comply with all requirements set forth in NIST-800-53. This includes robust logging of access to data, periodic audits, and monitoring for abnormal use patterns. Data access incidents will be reported to the relevant parties immediately upon being discovered.
