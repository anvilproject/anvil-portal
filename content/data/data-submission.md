# Data Submission 

[[heroSmall]]
| The AnVIL is a premier location for hosting valuable data sets.. 

Submitting data to be hosted on the AnVIL increases the visibility of the data and further increases the value of the collective “AnVIL data” by extending the diversity and breadth of data analysis options.
 
 The AnVIL team is in the process of formalizing the data submission pipeline. If you have questions about hosting your data on the AnVIL please feel free to reach out to the [AnVIL Team](anvil-project-managers@lists.anvilproject.org) or complete our [onboarding form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3NViQ8bTkXexqJ7QukcIcSwe1OLlIirScvaP7YXq4TMqa7A/viewform).
