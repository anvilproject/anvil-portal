# Dataset Inventory

<hero small>Currently, AnVIL data can be accessed through the Terra workspaces listed below. In the near future, the [Gen3 Data Explorer](https://gen3.org/) will allow for selection of datasets and the creation of virtual cohorts that can then be analyzed in a users personal or shared Terra workspace.</hero>



### Public Datasets

### dbGaP Accessible Datasets

### Consortia Access Datasets

## Public Access Worspaces

## Controlled Access Workspaces
The following workspaces are accessible by external (non-consortia) researhers via the [dbGaP access process]() and also to consortia members via the [consortia fast track process]().

<data-workspaces study></data-workspaces study>

## Consortia Members Access Only (dbGaP Registraton in Progress)


> For workspaces with no dbGaP Id, the dbGaP study registration is in progress. The dbGap Ids will be displayed once assigned by dbGaP. 

>For workspaces where the dbGaP Id is not selectable, the dbGaP study registration is in progress.  The dbGaP Id has been assigned but the study is not yet listed in dbGaP.
