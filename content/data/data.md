## Accessing AnVIL Data via Terra Workspaces

Currently, AnVIL data can be accessed through the Terra workspaces listed below. In the near future, the [Gen3 Data Explorer](https://gen3.org/) will allow for selection of datasets and the creation of virtual cohorts that can then be analyzed in a users personal or shared Terra workspace.

To access data:

1. [Create an account](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces) in AnVIL Terra and link your eRA Commons / NIH account.
1. Request access to the study in using dbGaPs [Authorized Access Portal](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) with the study's phsId. See NCBI's [Starting Point to Applying for dbGaP Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99225/) for more information.
1. Once your access is approved, your data will appear as one or more workspaces in your Terra account.  

Please see the [Requesting Data Access](/data/requesting-data-access) and [Once Your Access is Granted](/data/requesting-data-access#once-your-access-is-granted) guides for more detai.  

## Studies (25)

_Needs an introduction._ 

_Should we roll up "Cohorts" studies and display that in the table?_

_Should we separate out completely ingested studies from ones that are lacking some subjects?_

### Coming Soon - dbGaP Study Registration in Progress

> For workspaces with no dbGaP Id, the dbGaP study registration is in progress. The dbGap Ids will be displayed once assigned by dbGaP. 

>For workspaces where the dbGaP Id is not selectable, the dbGaP study registration is in progress.  The dbGaP Id has been assigned but the study is not yet listed in dbGaP.
