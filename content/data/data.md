Search AnVIL's datasets and associated Terra workspaces for datasets of interest.

Open access datasets are accessible to all upon logging into [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces)  or [Gen3](https://gen3.theanvil.io). To request access for datasets with access restrictions, see AnVIL's guides for requesting access to [Controlled Access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access#accessing-controlled-access-data) and [Consortium Access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access#accessing-consortium-access-data) datasets.

[Once your access is approved](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access#once-your-access-is-granted), and assuming you have [linked your eRA Commons ID with your Terra acount](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360038086332-Linking-Terra-to-External-Servers), your new workspaces will appear in your Terra workspaces tab ready for you to [clone](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360026130851-How-to-clone-a-workspace) and explore.

## Notes

> For workspaces with no dbGaP Id, the dbGaP study registration is in progress. The dbGap Ids will be displayed once assigned by dbGaP. 

>For workspaces where the dbGaP Id is not selectable, the dbGaP study registration is in progress.  The dbGaP Id has been assigned but the study is not yet listed in dbGaP. Once the study is listed in dbGaP non-consortia members will be able to request access via dbGaP.

 See the [Requesting Data Access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access) guide for information on AnVIL's access types, how to request access and what to do once your access request is approved.
