# AnVIL Consortia

<hero small>AnVIL hosts data from the following programs and also allows users to submit their own data to the platform.</hero>

## Consortia
### Current Consortia

### Planned Consortia

The following consortia are planned for data ingestion. Additional consortia are under consideration and will be listed as they are approved.

* [Covid19hg](https://www.covid19hg.org) -  The COVID-19 host genetics initiative  
* [CSER](https://cser-consortium.org ) - Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research
* [GTExv9](https://gtexportal.org/home/) - Genotype-Tissue Expression Project
* [HPP](https://humanpangenome.org/) - Human Pan Genome Reference Consortium
* [NIA](https://www.nia.nih.gov/) - National Institute of Aging
* [NIMH](https://nda.nih.gov/) - National Institute of Mental Health
* [UDN](https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/) - Undiagnosed Disease Network

## Datasets
### Accessing AnVIL Data via Terra Workspaces

Currently, AnVIL data can be accessed through the Terra workspaces listed below. In the near future, the [Gen3 Data Explorer](https://gen3.org/) will allow for selection of datasets and the creation of virtual cohorts that can then be analyzed in a user's personal or shared Terra workspace.

To access data:

1. [Create an account](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces) in AnVIL Terra and link your eRA Commons / NIH account.
1. Request access to the study in using dbGaPs [Authorized Access Portal](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) with the study's phsId. See NCBI's [Starting Point to Applying for dbGaP Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99225/) for more information.
1. Once your access is approved, your data will appear as one or more workspaces in your Terra account.  

Please see the [Requesting Data Access](/data/requesting-data-access) and [Once Your Access is Granted](/data/requesting-data-access#once-your-access-is-granted) guides for more detail.  

### Public Access Datasets

### Researcher Access Datasets
<hero small>The following workspaces are accessible by external (non-consortia) researchers via the [dbGaP access process](/data/requesting-data-access#requesting-researcher-data-access-as-an-external-researcher) and also to consortia members via the [consortia fast track process](/data/requesting-data-access#requesting-data-access-as-a-consortium-member).</hero>

### Consortia Access Datasets

<hero small>The following datasets are currently accessible by consortia members only. Once the studies are registered in dbGaP they will also be accessible to external researchers.</hero>


> For workspaces with no dbGaP Id, the dbGaP study registration is in progress. The dbGap Ids will be displayed once assigned by dbGaP. 

>For workspaces where the dbGaP Id is not selectable, the dbGaP study registration is in progress.  The dbGaP Id has been assigned but the study is not yet listed in dbGaP. Once the study is listed in dbGaP non-consortia members will be able to request access via dbGaP.
