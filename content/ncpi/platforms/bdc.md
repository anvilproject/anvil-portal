## Tools

BioData Catalyst is being designed to support workflows for batch data analysis, notebooks for interactive analysis, and apps/services for web apps. Users can bring their own workflows and notebooks.

### Workflows
BioData Catalyst supports workflows written in CWL and WDL. Highlights include workflows from the DCC and TOPMed alignment and variant calling.

### Notebooks
RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks are supported with examples leveraging BioData Catalyst for image visualization, machine learning, and GPU acceleration.

### Apps/Services
Access and Search Clinical and WGS annotated data via PIC-SURE User Interface and API.

## Authentication/Authorization

- eRA Commons IDs are used for controlled access data via Data Commons Framework Services (DCFC).

- Expecting integration with NIH RAS through DCFC integration for authentication and authorization.
- DCFSâ€™ dbGaP integration is used to streamline access for those with completed dbGaP applications.

## Indexing

- Data objects are assigned permanent globally unique IDs (GUIDs) to allow for access across tools, without requiring copies be created and transferred.

- Datasets can be located through text-based and faceted/tagged search. Semantic Search under development.

## Data Modeling
Working toward data interoperability using standards from GA4GH and CD2H with FHIR and BioLink as meta models

## Cloud Credits
NHLBI currently provides $500 in cloud credits to new users of BioData Catalyst on BioData Catalyst Powered by Seven Bridges or BioData Catalyst Powered by Terra.
Users can also use AWS or GCP accounts or apply for additional credits via NHLBI BioData Catalyst Cloud Credit Program.
