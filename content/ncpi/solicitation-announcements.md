### 2023 Interoperability Solicitation FAQs

This section contains answers to questions received about the
current [Solicitation Announcement for Interoperability Projects](#nih-cloud-platform-interoperability-ncpi-effort-project-solicitation-announcement-march-2023).
It will be updated periodically as new questions are received and answered.

**Date of last update: 05/04/2023.**

#### FAQ1

*Question*: How many interoperability awards are expected to be distributed?\
*Answer*: NIH has not specified a limit to the number of interoperability projects to be awarded. They will evaluate
submissions and make funding decisions for those that have the most merit according to the evaluation criteria in the
Announcement. Per the solicitation announcement, “NIH will make all funding decisions” and they will communicate their
decisions to the ACC.

#### FAQ2

*Question*: Are there limits to the amount of cloud credits that can be budgeted in a proposal?\
*Answer*: There are no limits to the amount of cloud resources requested, although these should be justified by the
proposed work. Cloud costs should not be included in your budget; however, the estimated need for and cost of cloud
credits should be noted in your proposed work plan.

#### FAQ3 (modified 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Which institutions/researchers are eligible to submit?\
*Answer*: The requirement is for at least two NCPI partner systems to be actively involved and funded in each proposal.
In addition, the lead PI should be from a current NCPI system. Other institutions may be partners on the proposal. Each
participating institution should contribute a separate budget file as part of any jointly submitted proposal.

#### FAQ4

*Question*: Can the announcement be shared with investigators not included in the Invitation email?\
*Answer*: Yes, please feel free to share the solicitation with colleagues and collaborators. Note the requirement to
partner with existing NCPI systems on the previous question. Please share the link to this page, where we will continue
to provide updates and additional FAQs.

#### FAQ5

*Question*: Is it a requirement that **all** collaborating institutes on the proposal be current NCPI partner systems?\
*Answer*: Per Eligibility Section of the Solicitation (page 4), proposals must involve at least two current NCPI partner
systems. In addition, the lead PI should be from current NCPI system. Additional partners who are not currently part of
NCPI would be welcome to participate in the proposal as well.

#### FAQ6 (modified 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Is it a requirement that the lead PI be from a current NCPI partner system?\
*Answer*: Yes. The lead PI should be from one of the five current NCPI systems. Also, the applicant should provide
institutional attestation that the applicant can serve as PI; The Contact of the PI of the system should endorse the
applicant as PI of the interoperability project.

#### FAQ7

*Question*: Is a researcher, not associated to a NCPI system, limited to only participate in one proposal for this
current call for proposals, or can the researcher collaborate on multiple proposals?\
*Answer*: There is no limit to the number of proposals any particular PI or NCPI system can participate in. All system
partners participating in a given interoperability project must work together to compose a proposal. This includes NCBI
staff for proposals that involve dbGaP/SRA. Each system may participate in multiple interoperability projects. NIH
encourages and expects systems and platforms to prioritize the proposals in which they participate based on the
potential for substantive involvement and the potential impact on the performance and mission of the system.

#### FAQ8 (modified 04/24/2023)

*Question*: Can a proposal be submitted, even if a Letter of Intent is not submitted?\
*Answer*: Yes, a researcher does not have to submit a Letter of Intent to still submit a proposal. Letters of Intent
help NIH with review planning activities. If you missed the Letter of Intent deadline, you are still eligible to submit
a proposal on or before the May 15th deadline.

#### FAQ9 (modified 04/24/2023)

*Question*: Can you clarify whether the expected total budget is for $500k in direct costs over two years or $500k per
year for two years?\
*Answer*: The expected total direct costs is $500K or less per year, not including requests for cloud credits. The
project period/duration can be up to 2 years. Requested budgets above $500k per year should be commensurate and
justified by the number of participating platforms and the complexity of the proposed scope. The total budget is for the
entire duration of the proposed project period – not budget per year.

#### FAQ 10

*Question*: RTI is a member of Biodata Catalyst, is the organization (RTI) allowed to submit a proposal? This would
involve different people from RTI from the ACC team – none of the ACC team members would participate in the proposal
process.\
*Answer*: Yes. RTI can collaborate on Interoperability Projects. In their role as lead for the NCPI Administrative
Coordinating center, RTI will be providing logistic support and technical expertise to NIH and will not influence
funding decisions.

#### FAQ 11

*Question*: Can someone propose multiple projects that relate back to a single overarching research objective? Does the
scientific research question need to be confined to a single proposal or can it be spread across multiple?\
*Answer*: It’s understood that a single scientific use case may motivate multiple technical approaches. There may be
more than one interoperability project addressing the same scientific use case.

#### FAQ 12

*Question*: Can interoperability projects support integration with NIH’s Researcher Auth Service (RAS)?\
*Answer*: Yes. Systems are encouraged to propose interoperability projects for RAS integration as needed.

#### FAQ13 (new 04/24/2023)

*Question*: How do you determine if a partner system is actively involved?\
*Answer*: A partner system is involved if personnel from that system will participate in technical development
activities and data from that system is part of the use case. The Solicitation Announcement lists current NCPI partners
on page 3.

#### FAQ14 (new 04/24/2023)

*Question*: Do I need to update the Letter of Intent to reflect the latest announcement update that was communicated on
4/3/2023?\
*Answer*: As described in the solicitation, LOIs will be reviewed by NIH staff for information and planning purposes
only. As such, you do not need to resubmit an updated Letter of Intent. Your submission (due on Monday, May 15 by 5pm
local time of applicant organization) can have the final budget you are proposing.

#### FAQ15 (new 04/24/2023)

*Question*: Is the preference to write one joint proposal, which will support the project’s overall vision for an
interoperable system, or to write multiple smaller proposals with budgets that comply with the announcement
requirements?\
*Answer*: If the proposal has multiple scientific goals that will all be served by the same technical scope – then this
should be covered in one proposal. Regarding the budget (size of the proposal), it’s fine to write a bigger proposal to
accomplish the goals of the research. NIH might ask to segment the proposed project into different aims or phases, so if
it does need to be descoped, NIH and the NCPI ACC would potentially have a path to achieve this with the investigator.

#### FAQ16 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Do we need to name an actual person or a persona (hypothetical person) of someone who would benefit?\
*Answer*: Per Page 3 of the Solicitation Announcement:

“The name of the researcher who proposed and would benefit from successful implementation of the use case. (This person
should also be named as personnel on the proposal).”

This needs to be a real person – and not a persona – and this person would need to be named in the personnel description
on the proposal. This person would benefit from the successful implementation of the use case.

While this guidance does imply that the use case is proposed by the researcher, the use case can technically be proposed
by anyone within the team. However, a real researcher should be included as someone who would benefit from the
successful implementation of the use case.

#### FAQ17 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Does NCPI require the 5-page max NIH Biosketch format?\
*Answer*: Biographical sketches do not need to comply with the 5 page maximum NIH Biosketch format. This may be the
format that NIH is most familiar with, but it would be your proposal team’s decision on whether to adapt to this format
or propose with your own.

#### FAQ18 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Is there a minimum # of key personnel that we must include?\
*Answer*: Per Page 4 of the Solicitation Announcement:

“A brief description of the teaming arrangements and personnel involved in the project including developers and
researchers and the role they will play. **At minimum, there should be two technical leads (one from each system)** and
**one research lead for each project**. (Additional information about personnel should be provided as biographical
sketches in the appendix.)”

“Key personnel are expected to attend one in-person meeting for the NCPI per year. The budget request should include
funds for travel, as appropriate.”

At a minimum, there would be three key personnel – two technical leads (one from each system) and one researcher. Also,
per the guidance on page 4, these team members are expected to attend one in-person meeting for the NCPI per year. The
budget proposed should include funds for travel, as appropriate.

#### FAQ19 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Where can I find the Excel budget template referred to on page 2 of the announcement?\
*Answer*: The Excel budget request template can be found on
the [Solicitation Announcement](/ncpi/solicitation-announcements) page of the NCPI public
website. It can be
directly <a href="./downloads/2023_NCPI_InteropProjects_CostProposalTemplate_v1.0.xlsx" target="_blank">downloaded</a>
from this page.

#### FAQ20 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Is the lead institution including collaborating partner’s indirect costs towards the overall direct cost
total? Or are they only to take into consideration the direct costs of each site for the overall $500K direct cost
budget limit per year and exclude the indirect costs?\
*Answer*: The indirect costs of your collaborating partners would not be included in the overall direct cost total of
your submission. Each collaborating institution/partner would independently submit a budget that would include their
direct and indirect costs. Each collaborating partner would take into consideration only their direct costs for their
site from the total direct cost budget limit per year and exclude the indirect, which is included in the Excel template
as another item.

#### FAQ21 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Upon award, is it anticipated that all funding will be provided to the lead institutions so that subawards
will be issued by the lead institution to collaborating institutions?\
*Answer*: If awarded, The NCPI ACC will provide separate sub-awards with each collaborating institution directly.

#### FAQ22 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Is the **“Proposal Questions Due Date”** of May 1st, a component of the application that is submitted
separately
or is this for any final clarifying questions from sites regarding this announcement? Also, can we submit questions
after the May 1st deadline.\
*Answer*: The Proposal Questions Due Date is given as deadline to strongly encourage all interested applicants to submit
their remaining questions by May 1st. Even though this is a stated deadline, the ACC will continue to answer questions
after May 1st. However, the ACC does not guarantee that questions asked after the deadline will be answered before the
Proposal Due Date (May 15th).

#### FAQ23 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Should the lead institution that is submitting the proposal include the subaward institutions in their Excel
budget?\
*Answer*: No, each collaborating institution would independently produce a separate supporting budget that would include
their direct and indirect costs. Also, each collaborating institution would take into consideration only their direct
costs for their site from the total direct cost budget limit per year and exclude the indirect, which is included in the
Excel template as another item.

#### FAQ24 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Should the lead institution submit the content requirements (as stated in the solicitation) as 1 proposal
package for all institutions including separate Excel budgets for each institution?\
*Answer*: Yes, all collaborating institutions must work together to compose a single project proposal. Also, as stated
in the budget section of the [announcement](/ncpi/solicitation-announcements) (page 4), each project should submit
separate Excel documents for each participating institution. The file name of the Excel document should reflect the
institution name for each separate budget proposed.

#### FAQ25 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Should the Contact PI or the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) from the lead institution submit
the proposal including all budgets from the collaborating institutions?\
*Answer*: Either the Contact PI or the Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) can submit the proposal and
corresponding budgets via email to <ncpi-info@od.nih.gov>.

#### FAQ26 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Do the Evaluation Criteria and Review Questions, on page 5 of the announcement, also need to be submitted by
a business official or the contact PI at the proposal lead institution?\
*Answer*: The Evaluation Criteria and Review Questions are not to be included/answered in the proposal; they are
references for you and your team to keep in mind when preparing the proposal. Also, they reflect the elements NIH will
consider when evaluating the proposal.

#### FAQ27 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: The announcement says that the proposal needs to include representatives of at least 2 different NCPI
members, does this mean full active co-I's/Senior Personnel involved in development, or can this be us submitting a
Scientific Use case that would access two different platforms with Letters of Support?\
*Answer*: The proposal needs to include representatives of at least 2 different NCPI members.
The [announcement](/ncpi/solicitation-announcements) says (page 4): “A brief description of the teaming arrangements and
personnel involved in the project including developers and researchers and the role they will play. **At minimum, there
should be two technical leads (one from each system) and one research lead for each project**. (Additional information
about personnel should be provided as biographical sketches in the appendix.)”, meaning full active co-I's/Senior
Personnel involved in development.

#### FAQ28 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Is there any consideration of adjusting the submission due date beyond May 15?\
*Answer*: Currently, the NIH is not planning to adjust the submission due date beyond May 15, 2023.

#### FAQ29 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Should we follow general NIH guidelines for formatting? Are there any specifics on margins, font, URLs,
general formatting that we should be aware of for this proposal submission?\
*Answer*: You do not need to follow general NIH guidelines for formatting. This may be the format that NIH is most
familiar with, but it would be your proposal team’s decision on whether to adapt to this format or propose with your
own.

There are no specifics on margins, font, URLs, general formatting for this proposal submission.

#### FAQ30 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Who can provide answer questions regarding the purpose and scope of the opportunity?\
*Answer*: Please direct your questions about the purpose and scope of the opportunity to NIH, as stated in the
announcement, “Inquiries regarding the purpose and scope of this announcement should be directed to:
<ncpi-info@od.nih.gov>”.

#### FAQ31 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Can you confirm that there’s one research lead per proposal, as opposed to one research lead per system or
one research lead per participating institution?\
*Answer*: Yes, there should be one research lead per proposal/project. Also, **at a minimum**, there should be **two
technical leads** (one from each system).

#### FAQ32 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Must the person responsible for the use case (if different than the research and/or proposal lead) attend
the NCPI meetings?\
*Answer*: Investigators identified as key personnel are expected to attend one in-person meeting for the NCPI per year.
It would be up to the project team to identify key personnel to attend the NCPI in-person annual meetings. The
researcher who would benefit from the use case (if different from the research and/or proposal lead) does not
necessarily have to be named as key personnel. But per the guidance on page 3 of the Solicitation Announcement, this
person should be named as personnel on the proposal.

#### FAQ33 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: We are to budget travel for Key Personnel. Can you confirm where people will be traveling to and for how
many nights their stay is anticipated?\
*Answer*: The location and number of nights of the in-person meeting have not been decided yet. For planning purposes,
travel costs may be estimated based on the previously hosted 2-day workshops listed on the NCPI Public
Website ([https://anvilproject.org/ncpi/progress-updates](/ncpi/progress-updates)). We are anticipating the next NCPI
Workshop to be in the mid to late Fall of 2023. The location is tentatively Washington, DC, but you should estimate
costs for East Coast, USA.

#### FAQ34 (new 05/03/2023)

*Question*: Where should citations/references be included? Should that be considered within the 10-pages limit for the
narrative?\
*Answer*: So as not to impose on the 10-page limit for the proposal narrative, citations may be placed in an Appendix.
They may also be included in the proposal narrative, as either a separate section, or footnote, page limit permitting.
