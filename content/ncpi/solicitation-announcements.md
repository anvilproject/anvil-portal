*Question*: How many interoperability awards are expected to be distributed?\
*Answer*: NIH has not specified a limit to the number of interoperability projects to be awarded. They will evaluate submissions and make funding decisions for those that have the most merit according to the evaluation criteria in the Announcement. Per the solicitation announcement, “NIH will make all funding decisions” and they will communicate their decisions to the ACC.

*Question*: Are there limits to the amount of cloud credits that can be budgeted in a proposal?\
*Answer*: There are no limits to the amount of cloud resources requested, although these should be justified by the proposed work.  Cloud costs should not be included in your budget; however, the estimated need for and cost of cloud credits should be noted in your proposed work plan.

*Question*: Which institutions/researchers are eligible to submit?\
*Answer*: The requirement is for at least two NCPI partner systems to be actively involved and funded in each proposal.  Other institutions may be partners on the proposal. Each participating institution should submit a separate budget file as part of any jointly submitted proposal.

*Question*: Can the announcement be shared with investigators not included in the Invitation email?\
*Answer*: Yes, please feel free to share the solicitation with colleagues and collaborators. Note the requirement to partner with existing NCPI systems on the previous question.  

*Question*: Is it a requirement that all collaborating institutes on the proposal be current NCPI partner systems?\
*Answer*: Per Eligibility Section of the Solicitation (page 4), proposals must involve at least two current NCPI partner systems. Additional partners who are not currently part of NCPI would be welcome to participate in the proposal as well.

*Question*: Is it a requirement that the lead PI be from a current NCPI partner system?\
*Answer*: Yes. The lead PI should be from one of the five current NCPI systems.

*Question*: Can a proposal be submitted, even if a Letter of Intent is not submitted?\
*Answer*: Yes, a researcher does not have to submit a Letter of Intent to still submit a proposal. Letters of Intent help NIH with review planning activities.
