### 2023 Interoperability Solicitation FAQs

This section contains answers to questions received about the current [Solicitation Announcement for Interoperability Projects](#nih-cloud-platform-interoperability-ncpi-effort-project-solicitation-announcement-march-2023). It will be updated periodically as new questions are received and answered.

**Date of last update: 03/30/2023.**

#### FAQ1

*Question*: How many interoperability awards are expected to be distributed?\
*Answer*: NIH has not specified a limit to the number of interoperability projects to be awarded. They will evaluate submissions and make funding decisions for those that have the most merit according to the evaluation criteria in the Announcement. Per the solicitation announcement, “NIH will make all funding decisions” and they will communicate their decisions to the ACC.

#### FAQ2

*Question*: Are there limits to the amount of cloud credits that can be budgeted in a proposal?\
*Answer*: There are no limits to the amount of cloud resources requested, although these should be justified by the proposed work.  Cloud costs should not be included in your budget; however, the estimated need for and cost of cloud credits should be noted in your proposed work plan.

#### FAQ3

*Question*: Which institutions/researchers are eligible to submit?\
*Answer*: The requirement is for at least two NCPI partner systems to be actively involved and funded in each proposal.  In addition, the lead PI should be from current NCPI system.  Other institutions may be partners on the proposal. Each participating institution should submit a separate budget file as part of any jointly submitted proposal.

#### FAQ4

*Question*: Can the announcement be shared with investigators not included in the Invitation email?\
*Answer*: Yes, please feel free to share the solicitation with colleagues and collaborators. Note the requirement to partner with existing NCPI systems on the previous question.  Please share the link to this page, where we will continue to provide updates and additional FAQs.

#### FAQ5

*Question*: Is it a requirement that **all** collaborating institutes on the proposal be current NCPI partner systems?\
*Answer*: Per Eligibility Section of the Solicitation (page 4), proposals must involve at least two current NCPI partner systems. In addition, the lead PI should be from current NCPI system.   Additional partners who are not currently part of NCPI would be welcome to participate in the proposal as well.

#### FAQ6

*Question*: Is it a requirement that the lead PI be from a current NCPI partner system?\
*Answer*: Yes. The lead PI should be from one of the five current NCPI systems.

#### FAQ7

*Question*: Is a researcher, not associated to a NCPI system, limited to only participate in one proposal for this current call for proposals, or can the researcher collaborate on multiple proposals?\
*Answer*:  There is no limit to the number of proposals any particular PI or NCPI system can participate in.  All system partners participating in a given interoperability project must work together to compose a proposal. This includes NCBI staff for proposals that involve dbGaP/SRA. Each system may participate in multiple interoperability projects. NIH encourages and expects systems and platforms to prioritize the proposals in which they participate based on the potential for substantive involvement and the potential impact on the performance and mission of the system.

#### FAQ8

*Question*: Can a proposal be submitted, even if a Letter of Intent is not submitted?\
*Answer*: Yes, a researcher does not have to submit a Letter of Intent to still submit a proposal. Letters of Intent help NIH with review planning activities.

#### FAQ9

*Question*: Can you clarify whether the expected total budget is for $500k in direct costs over two years or $500k per year for two years?\
*Answer*: The expected total direct costs is $500K or less per year, not including requests for cloud credits. The project period/duration can be up to 2 years. Requested budgets above $500k per year should be commensurate and justified by the number of participating platforms and the complexity of the proposed scope.   

#### FAQ 10

*Question*: RTI is a member of Biodata Catalyst, is the organization (RTI) allowed to submit a proposal? This would involve different people from RTI from the ACC team – none of the ACC team members would participate in the proposal process.\
*Answer*: Yes.  RTI can collaborate on Interoperability Projects.  In their role as lead for the NCPI Administrative Coordinating center, RTI will be providing logistic support and technical expertise to NIH and will not influence funding decisions.  

#### FAQ 11

*Question*: Can someone propose multiple projects that relate back to a single overarching research objective? Does the scientific research question need to be confined to a single proposal or can it be spread across multiple?\
*Answer*: It’s understood that a single scientific use case may motivate multiple technical approaches.  There may be more than one interoperability project addressing the same scientific use case.  

#### FAQ 12

*Question*: Can interoperability projects support integration with NIH’s Researcher Auth Service (RAS)?\
*Answer*: Yes.  Systems are encouraged to propose interoperability projects for RAS integration as needed.
