#Resources for AnVIL Users
##Which NHGRI datasets does AnVIL host?
The current list of large-scale datasets which will be available through AnVIL are:
- GSP, including CMGs and CCDGs
- GTEx
- 1000 Genomes
- eMERGE
- CSER (coming soon)

The AnVIL Data Dashboard provides a real time view of which data sets and individual projects are available on [AnVIL](/data).

##What user training will AnVIL provide?
AnVIL will offer training materials, online Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) modules as well as periodic workshops to engage with the AnVIL user community.

##How does AnVIL handle users’ cloud service costs?
The AnVIL utilizes the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Cloud storage, data egress and computing services of the AnVIL are provided under a ‘user-pays, pass-through’ model. Users of the AnVIL pay for the services they consume on the GCP at the rate charged by the cloud vendor (<https://cloud.google.com/pricing/>) with no additional charges or licensing fees. Users do not pay storage fees for data hosted by AnVIL, but any derivative data created by the user will incur storage fees.

A new Terra user is eligible for the [free credits program](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360027940952#Free%20Credits%20Overview). The program begins once you accept the Terms and Conditions, and will expire either after 60 days or after you have used $300 worth of credits, whichever happens first. NHGRI is also planning to provide AnVIL users with credits for cloud service charges at the discounted rate negotiated by the [NIH STRIDES](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) initiative with GCP.
