#Training

[[heroSmall]]
| The AnVIL is creating a scalable training program with a focus on researchers and use cases.

Through a combination of online courses, in-person workshops, and course materials, content will be created using the [FAIR data principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and tailored to a variety of scenarios. Specific modules will be created for data consumers, data analysts, methods developers, and principal investigators.
