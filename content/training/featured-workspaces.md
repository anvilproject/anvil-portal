#Featured Workspaces

The AnVIL project's featured workspaces demonstrate common genomic analysis pipelines deployed using data and tools available on AnVIL.

These analyses utilize unrestricted public data along with reproducible workflows, allowing researchers to clone and execute the workspaces as a learning exercise or for adapting to their own research.

The featured workspaces are hosted from within an [AnVIL branded Terra instance](https://anvil.terra.bio/#).
