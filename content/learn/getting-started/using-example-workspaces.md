#Using Example Workspaces

Browsing and cloning example workspaces is a great way to get started using AnVIL.

The AnVIL project's example workspaces demonstrate common genomic analysis pipelines deployed using data and tools available on AnVIL.
 
 These analyses utilize unrestricted public data along with reproducible workflows, allowing researchers to clone and execute the workspaces as a learning exercise or for adapting to their own research.

## Prerequisites
The example workspaces listed below may be viewed with only a Terra account. To use the workspace and run or modify its associated tutorial, you will need to:
 
 1. [Link your Terra account with a Google billing account](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360026182251-How-to-set-up-billing-projects-and-Google-Billing-Accounts).

 1. [Clone the example workspace](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360026130851-How-to-clone-a-workspace) into your billing account before runing the workspace's analysis pipeline or interactive analysis.

## Additional Example Workspaces

Terra contains many [additional example workspaces](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360028967111-Start-with-curated-sample-workspaces-for-a-variety-of-use-cases) that are useful for getting started.
