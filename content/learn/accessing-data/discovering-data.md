#Finding and Accessing Datasets


- [Discovering datasets](/data) - Datasets of interest can be discovered in [AnVILâ€™s dataset catalog](/data), the [Gen3 Data Explorer](https://gen3.theanvil.io/) and by reviewing data-focused workspaces available to you once you are logged into Terra.

- [Requesting dataset access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access) - AnVIL's open access datasets are accessible to all upon logging into [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces)  or [Gen3](https://gen3.theanvil.io). To request access for datasets with access restrictions, see AnVIL's guides for requesting access to [Controlled Access](#accessing-controlled-access-data) and [Consortium Access](#accessing-consortium-access-data) datasets.

- [Once your access is approved](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access#once-your-access-is-granted) - the workspaces associated with your new datasets will be listed on your Terra workspaces tab.  [Clone](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360026130851-How-to-clone-a-workspace) the workspace to begin working with the dataset.
