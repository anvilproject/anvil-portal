# Accessing Data with DRS URIs in Terra 

Varying formats for identifying data stored on different cloud-based infrastructures make it challenging to combine data across cloud infrastructures effectively.

The GA4GH Data Repository Service (DRS) defines a generic interface for data repositories to allow access to data in a single, standard way. DRS gives a dataset on any infrastructure a unique ID mapping that allows for flexible retrieval. 

For an in depth discussion of GA4GH DRS URIs, what they are for, and how to use them, please see the Terra documentation: [Data Access with the GA4GH Data Repository Service (DRS)](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360039330211).
