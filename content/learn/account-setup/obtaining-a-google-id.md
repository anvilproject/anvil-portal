# Obtaining a Google ID


A Google ID is a Google level resource required to create GCP and Terra accounts.

A Google ID is simply an email address. This email address must be either: a non Google email address that you have associated with a Google Account or a Gmail, Google Workspace (formerly GSuite), or Google Identity email address.

If you do not have a Google ID and wish to create one: 

1. See [Create Your Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp) to register for a Gmail account or create an account with your non-Google email address.


>To create a Google ID with a non-Google email address select “Use my current email address instead” on the signup form.

See [Set up Terra account with non-Google email](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029186611-Setting-up-a-Google-account-with-a-non-Google-email) for additinal instructions on how to create a Google account using a non-Google email address.
