# Creating a Google Cloud Billing Account

Google Cloud Billing Accounts allow you to configure payment and track spending in GCP.

<hero>Note that you may not need a Google Cloud Billing Account if someone else, e.g., a colleague, a lab, or cloud credits program, will be managing and paying for your compute costs.</hero>

>Check with your institutional procurement office for a preferred method to set up your Google Cloud Account, such as using a third-party reseller or an existing account

### Prerequisites

Before setting up your Google Cloud Billing Account:

1. Decide what email address to use. The email you choose must be associated with a Google ID (see [Obtaining a Google ID](/learn/account-setup/obtaining-a-google-id)) and must be the email you will use to log in to Terra.
1. Decide what payment method (credit card, debit card, PayPal, or bank account) you will use.
1. Determine if you will set up as an individual or business. If you are setting up an account for a company, organization, lab, or institution, select "Business.” If you are setting up as yourself, choose “Individual.”

## Setup Guide

**To create your first Google Cloud Billing Account:**

1. Sign in to the Manage billing accounts page in the Google Cloud Console. If this is your first time logging into GCP, you will be asked to agree to the terms of service.

See [Google Cloud Free Program](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier) to understand more about Google’s 90-day, $300 free trial and free tier. </hero>

>Note that you will not be “auto charged” on the free trial ends. You won’t be charged unless you manually upgrade to a paid account.

### Viewing your new GCP Billing Account
