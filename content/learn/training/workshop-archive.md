## Workshops


### Terra, AnVIL, R / Bioconductor Popup Workshops

These popup workshops provide short (less than 1 hour) virtual sessions to highlight specific parts of the Terra / AnVIL ecosystem for R and Bioconductor users. The sessions are easy for participants to join and follow along, with minimal prerequisite skills or knowledge. The main goal is to engage and enable use of Terra / AnVIL by R users.

For a workshop videos and tutorials see [Bioconductor Popup Workshops](/learn/data-analysts#bioconductor-popup-workshops).
