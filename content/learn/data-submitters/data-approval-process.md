# Data Approval Process

To deposit data into AnVIL, data submitters must first get approval from:
- National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
- The AnVIL ingestion committee

Note that datasets need to be registered in a central catalog (likely to remain dbGaP).

## NHGRI Approval

The NHGRI Program Officer must provide a written attestation that the AnVIL team will be permitted to store, index, and access data on the AnVIL. This must include a list of people who are designated to speak and make decisions on behalf of the institution.

Data must also be submitted in a way that is consistent with the requirements of the [NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Policies-Guidance/Genomic-Data-Sharing). To ensure this, institutions will need to submit an Institutional Certification, which must include:

1. Confirmation  that data conform to all applicable laws
2. Limitations for sharing, based on the informed consent of the research participants.
3. The NHGRI Genomic Program Administrator who currently registers the study.

The AnVIL team can provide an Institutional Certification template form.


### AnVIL Data Ingestion Committee Approval

The AnVIL data ingestion committee includes NHGRI program officers and AnVIL leadership team members who evaluate ingestion applications to ensure data deposited into AnVIL meets the high quality of the  NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) data standards.

After the AnVIL data ingestion committee approves datasets for ingestion, an approval notice will be sent via email to the applicant.

### Ethical Review

All scientific investigations should be undertaken with the highest priority given to the ethical requirements of such inquiries. As such, the ethical collection of both the data and of the submitting parties itself will be evaluated by AnVIL Program Directors and DIC before a determination for inclusion in the AnVIL.    

### Data Retention

During the initial discussions and vetting with the Data Ingestion Committee, the committee will coordinate with the dataset stewards to determine a reasonable timeframe for retention of data within the AnVIL, as well as any other provisions around the long term storage, archival, and availability of the data.
