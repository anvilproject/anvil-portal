# Step 1 - Register Data/Obtain Approval

<hero>

AnVIL strives to balance the goals of ensuring that data is as widely and freely available as possible while safeguarding the rights and privacy of subjects who participate in NIH-sponsored research.

This includes protecting the confidential and proprietary genomic and phenotypic data of individual human participants. See [NIH - Data Sharing Guidance](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/data_sharing_guidance.htm).

</hero>


To deposit large-scale, individual-level data into AnVIL, data submitters must:

1. Register their study       
2. Obtain approval from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) or appropriate Institutes and Centers (IC)     
3. Obtain approval from the AnVIL ingestion committee

## 1.1. Register your study      
Before beginning, you will want to make sure your data are compatible with the AnVIL, and register your data with dbGaP or the appropriate [Genome Program Administrator](https://osp.od.nih.gov/genomic-program-administrators/#:~:text=Genomic%20Program%20Administrators%20(GPAs)%20are,for%20the%20NIH%20GDS%20Policy) (GPA). This will significantly streamline the data submission process. Note that you can register your study in parallel with the other approval steps (1.2 and 1.3). See below for the exact steps to register and who to contact (depends on the kind of data you ahve and how your study is funded).            

**Note that AnVIL strongly recommends you take care of the study registration in parallel with the steps outlined in the rest of the Data Submitters docs.**   
   
### Human study? Register with dbGap   

The exact steps to register your study depend on how your study is funded. See [this link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/about.cgi) for more detail about dbGaP and how to register your study data.               

#### NHGRI-funded researcher?   
- Contact **NHGRI GPA Jennifer Strasburger** at [strasbuj@mail.nih.gov](mailto:strasbuj@mail.nih.gov)    
- You will receive two forms to complete: 1) an **institutional certification (IC) and 2) basic study information (BSI)**     
- Submit the signed forms back to GPA, who will initiate study registration   

#### NIH-funded researcher? 
- Contact your Institutes and Centers GPA (if you don't know your GPA, refer to [this list](https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/IC_GPAs.pdf)) 
- You will receive two forms to complete: 1) an **institutional certification (IC) and 2) basic study information (BSI)** 
- Submit the signed forms back to GPA who will initiate study registration     

#### non-NIH-funded?
- Contact **NHGRI GPA Jennifer Strasburger** at [strasbuj@mail.nih.gov](mailto:strasbuj@mail.nih.gov)    
- You will receive three forms to complete: 1) **institutional certification (IC), 2) basic study information (BSI) and [non-NIH form](https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/media/files/2021-01/ExtramuralNHGRI_DSP_post2021_revised012121.pdf)**. 
  - This extra form is provided to the NHGRI data access committee (DAC) who will make the determination to take on the new study registration and review of data access requests
- Submit signed forms back to GPA who will initiate study registration    

### Non-human data? Register with GEO
 


## 1.2. Obtain NHGRI Approval

### NIH/NHGRI Data Sharing Policy compliance   
Submitted data must be consistent with the requirements of the [NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Policies-Guidance/Genomic-Data-Sharing).    

### Working from an NIH grant? 
If your grant explicitly states that grantees are expected to share data in the AnVIL, you have this covered by default. Submit a copy of your grant award and [NHGRI Extramural Genomic Data Sharing Plan and dbGaP Submission Information](https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/media/files/2021-01/ExtramuralNHGRI_DSP_post2021_revised012121.pdf) to your AnVIL contact.  

### Other funding sources    
For other work, including Parent Announcements where data deposition in a certain repository wasnâ€™t described, PIs should do **one of** the following:    

**Option 1**:  Submit a copy of the [NHGRI Genomic Data Sharing Plan template](https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/media/files/2021-01/ExtramuralNHGRI_DSP_post2021_revised012121.pdf) - with AnVIL checked off at the bottom of the first page - to your  AnVIL approval contact. You may have already filled out this doc, or you can fill out just for this purpose.  

or

**Option 2**: Submit **both** of the following    
 1. Email (from PD) stating the AnVIL team has permission to store, index, and access data on the AnVIL and including a list of people designated to speak and make decisions on behalf of the institution **and**   

2. An Institutional Certification, which must include: 
   - Confirmation that data conform to all applicable laws 
   - Limitations for sharing, based on the informed consent of the research participants
   - The NHGRI Genomic Program Administrator who currently registers the study 

The AnVIL team can provide an Institutional Certification template form. 


## 1.3. Obtain AnVIL Data Ingestion Committee Approval

The AnVIL data ingestion committee will evaluate ingestion applications to ensure data deposited into AnVIL meets the high quality of the [NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Policies-Guidance/Genomic-Data-Sharing). The committee includes NHGRI program officers and AnVIL leadership team members.

When the AnVIL data ingestion committee approves datasets for ingestion, the applicant will receive an approval notice via email.     

### Ethical Review

All scientific investigations should be undertaken with the highest priority given to the ethical requirements of such inquiries. AnVIL Program Directors and DIC will evaluate the ethical collection of both the data and of the submitting parties before approving for inclusion in the AnVIL.

### Data Retention

The committee will coordinate with the dataset stewards to determine a reasonable timeframe for retention of data within the AnVIL, as well as any other provisions around the long-term storage, archival, and availability of the data. This will happen during the initial discussions and vetting with the Data Ingestion Committee
