# Submitting Data


After your dataset has been approved by the AnVIL data ingestion committee, follow these steps to submit data to the AnVIL:

1. Coordinate with AnVIL data ingest team.
1. Complete the AnVIL data submission form.
1. Prepare data for submission.
1. Deposit data into the AnVIL.

>Note: All submitted genomic data should be based on Human reference genome assembly GRCh37 or GRCh38.

> When submitting data to the AnVIL, please ensure your study has been registered in dbGaP. You will need to populate the data elements `dbGaP_study_ID` (phsXXXXXX).



## Prepare for AnVIL Data Submission
All data must conform to the [NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Policies-Guidance/Genomic-Data-Sharing).

- Gather dbGaP registration ID (phsID) and consent groups
  Please contact your program officer and the NHGRI Genomic Program Administrator for assistance and/or questions about dbGaP registration and/or consent groups.
- [Register for a Terra Account](/learn/account-setup/creating-a-terra-account) if you do not have one already.

## Data Submission Process

### 1 -  Coordinate with the AnVIL Data Ingest team
- Email <anvil-data@broadinstitute.org> to arrange an AnVIL kickoff meeting.

### 2 - Complete the AnVIL data submission form
The form gathers study information needed to create the deposit workspace including:
- Types of data (i.e., genomic, phenotypic, etc.)
- Consent codes
- Number of samples
- Submitter information (emails of all people who need access to the deposit workspace).

### 3 - Prepare data for submission
>To learn how data are stored and organized (i.e. using workspace tables) in the AnVIL, see [Managing Data with Workspace Tables](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360025758392-Managing-data-with-workspace-tables-) (estimated read time 15 minutes) or watch [Introduction to Data Tables in Terra](https://youtu.be/IeLywroCNNA) (5 minutes).

>For information on formatting requirements for data tables and template upload files, see [this article](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360059242671-Adding-data-to-a-workspace-with-a-template).

- See the [Data Requirements](/learn/consortia/data-requirements) section for more information about data/metadata requirements.

### 4. Deposit data into the AnVIL
- AnVIL Data Ingest Team will provide deposit workspace URL.
- Submitters will provide genomic files, phenotype, and metadata files.
- [How to move/copy data from the local cluster or Google bucket](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024056512-Moving-data-to-from-a-workspace-or-external-Google-bucket-).
- [Register service account to move data](https://github.com/broadinstitute/firecloud-tools/tree/master/scripts/register_service_account).
- Metadata files



#### Review AnVIL training
- For a video introduction to Terra, see [Terra Videos](/learn/videos/terra-videos).
- For an overview of the AnVIL platform and key concepts, see [Getting Started with AnVIL](/learn) and the [Workshop Archive](/learn/workshop-archive).
- Please contact the AnVIL Outreach team with support and training requests at <help@lists.anvilproject.org>

>While there are no charges for uploading and storing your data in AnVIL, in order to complete an analysis, you will need to connect a Google Billing Account to your Terra account. See [Overview of Billing Concepts](/learn/billing-setup/billing-concepts) and [Creating a Google Cloud Billing Account](/learn/billing-setup/creating-a-google-cloud-billing-account) for more information.
