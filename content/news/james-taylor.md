#James Peter Taylor | 1979 - 2020


April 3, 2020

Dr. James Taylor, co-Principal Investigator for the AnVIL Project and Ralph S. O’Connor Professor of Biology and Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, passed away on April 2, 2020. He was 40.

Dr. Taylor viewed AnVIL as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to democratize data-driven biomedical research. He worked tirelessly to promote open and reproducible science, leading teams in building foundational computational resources to support this vision. The AnVIL Project will continue to carry out Dr. Taylor’s goals.

A James Taylor Foundation is being created, which will support students pursuing research in computational genomics and open science. Details will be shared soon. Dr.  Taylor’s full obituary can be found on the [Galaxy Community Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/jxtx/).
