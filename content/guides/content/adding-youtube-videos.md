# Adding a YouTube Video

To include a YouTube video in your page:

1. Copy the YouTube url.
1. Reference the video in the markdown.

## Referencing the Video in the Markdown

To reference the video we use markdown like:

```
`video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JWOVGzzgMc&feature=youtu.be`
```

This renders like:

`video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JWOVGzzgMc&feature=youtu.be`
