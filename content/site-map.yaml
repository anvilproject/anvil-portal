## Site map
#
## menuItem
# - "menuItem" is the display name for the menuItem in the header or footer components.
# - "pageTitle" is the display name for the menuItem on the page (optional).
# - "pathPartial" builds the path for any navigationItems belonging to the menuItem. It is also the path for the menuItem in the header or footer.
# - "tabs" are the tabs belonging to the menuItem.
#
## tabs
# - "name" is the display name of the tab in the tab component.
# - "pathPartial" builds the path for any navigationItems belonging to the tab.
# - "navigationItems" are the markdown pages belonging to the tab, listed as a navigation item.
# Rules:
# - "name" as an empty string implies there are no tabs for the menuItem.
# - "pathPartial" as an empty string omits the partial from the navigation item's path.
# - The first navigationItem with a corresponding markdown file will become the tab's path.
#
## navigationItems
# - "name" is the display name of the navigation item in the navigation component.
# - "file" is the relative path of the markdown page.
# - "pathPartial" builds the path for the navigation item. Any parent partials are used to generate the full path.
# - "pathOverride" overrides/replaces any path generated for the navigation item.
# - "navigationItems" are children navigationItems belonging to the navigation item.
# Rules:
# - "pathPartial", "pathOverride", and "navigationItems" are optional.
# - "name" with an empty string will prevent the display of the navigation item. Typically used when only one page exists for the tab or menuItem.
# - "file" as an empty string will convert the navigation item to a "toggle" button to open/close children navigationItems belonging to the navigation item.
# - "pathPartial" as an empty string omits the partial from the navigation item's path. If "file" is valid, the partial will come from the markdown file name.
#    e.g. the markdown file "/team/working-groups.md" partial will be generated from the file name of the markdown file i.e. "working-groups".
#    If "file" is an empty string, the navigation item is a "toggle" button where the partial will be omitted from any children navigationItems paths.
# - "pathOverride" overrides and replaces any built paths from partials.
