### What are AnVIL Demos?
Join us to see a highlight of what you can do on AnVIL! AnVIL Demos will start out with a 30-minute demonstration on the platform followed by open time for Q&A and user support.

In the demos, presenters will highlight anything from a capability of the platform to a scientific analysis powered by AnVIL. If you’re interested in showcasing how you use AnVIL at a future AnVIL Demos session, reach out to [Natalie Kucher](mailto:nkucher3@jhu.edu).

After the demo, we’ll open up the floor to answer any questions about the demo and to answer any other questions you might have about AnVIL.

### What’s in this Demo?
#### 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM ET – Demo on AnVIL
Partners at the Broad User Education Team will share:
* WARP repo background and documentation
* How we develop and push our pipelines from GitHub --> Dockstore --> AnVIL/Terra
* How we use workspaces to showcase our pipelines to the public
* Finding our pipeline workspaces using AnVIL/Terra tags
* Example workspace and how the data in the workspace is public and downsampled so people can try it out low cost
#### 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM ET – Q&A
Participants will have an opportunity to ask questions about the demonstration and we will have AnVIL and Terra Support on the line to answer questions about AnVIL beyond the demo.
