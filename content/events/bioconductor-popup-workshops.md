<event-hero></event-hero>

These popup workshops provide short (less than 1 hour) virtual sessions to highlight specific parts of the Terra / [AnVIL][1] ecosystem for R and [Bioconductor][2] users. The sessions are easy for participants to join and follow along, with minimal prerequisite skills or knowledge; it is not necessary to attend all workshops. Sessions will have short presentations, with abundant opportunity for questions and 'round table' discussion about the topic of the workshop or other AnVIL-related activities. The main goal is to engage and enable use of Terra / AnVIL by R users. All sessions will be recorded and available after the workshop. Each workshop will include a short one-page summary of key learning objectives.

Please [SIGN UP][3] to receive connection information for each workshop.

## Schedule

All workshops are offered on Mondays at lunch time, 12:00 - 1:00 US Eastern, starting April 26.
