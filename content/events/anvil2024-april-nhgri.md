Are you interested in data and computational sciences?

Do you want to learn about analyzing large genomic datasets in the cloud?

Do you have some basic skills in python, R, or Galaxy?

The AnVIL team will host an in-person AnVIL workshop on June 17, 2024 at 11 am - 2 pm EDT. During the 3-hour workshop, participants learn about the AnVIL platform, a secure cloud-based platform that enables genomic data analysis at scale. AnVIL includes a number of analysis environments and platforms, including Galaxy, Bioconductor, and WDL Workflows. The workshop will feature hands-on demos to understand how to navigate in the platform, access and share data, and use some of the analysis tools in AnVIL.

Only open access data will be used, so participants will be able to access each dataset and analysis. Participants will be able to ask questions and interact with the presenters throughout the workshop. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a better understanding of how to use AnVIL for their genomic and other data analysis needs.

### Prerequisites (if any)

If you are interested in this workshop, please register using this form ([https://bit.ly/nhgri-irp-2024](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBoozrp5ZPA4aRJSwFPpEoVQtEAwouBrjEWuhhhmKwOhAP5w/viewform)) by June 14, 2024.

Material is targeted towards analysts who have a basic familiarity working with sequencing data (working with common genomic sequencing output file types, running tools on sequencing output files like quality control or assembly, or visualizing analysis results). Cloud credits will be provided for participants for the workshop.
