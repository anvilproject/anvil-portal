### What are AnVIL Demos?

Join us to see a highlight of what you can do on the NHGRI Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL), a cloud-based computing platform for genomic data science! AnVIL Demos will start out with a 30-minute demonstration on the platform followed by open time for Q&A and user support.

In the demos, presenters will highlight anything from a capability of the platform to a scientific analysis powered by AnVIL. If you’re interested in showcasing how you use AnVIL at a future AnVIL Demos session, reach out to [Natalie Kucher](mailto:nkucher3@jhu.edu).

After the demo, we’ll open up the floor to answer any questions about the demo and to answer any other questions you might have about AnVIL.

### What’s in this Demo?
#### 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM ET – Demo on AnVIL

In this demo, Frederick Tan will highlight a key benefit of using a cloud-based platform for data storage and compute: you can access and analyze the data right in the cloud, without having to move it around or download it! He will demonstrate how to bring together data that are stored in different workspaces to analyze them together.

#### 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM ET – Q&A

Participants will have an opportunity to ask questions about the demonstration and we will have AnVIL and Terra Support on the line to answer questions about AnVIL beyond the demo.
