Workshop attendees will be introduced to practical examples of how genomic data is used in research and clinical applications, highlighting techniques, technologies, and platforms used in genomic analysis. The current state of genomic science will be discussed, with emphasis on large scale sequencing projects of [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov) involving hundreds of thousands of individuals ([CCDG](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Common-Disease-Genomics), [CMG](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Mendelian-Genomics-CMG), [AnVIL](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL)).
