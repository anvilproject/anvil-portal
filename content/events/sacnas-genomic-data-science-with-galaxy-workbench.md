###Genomic data science with the Galaxy workbench
#####October 30th 2019
#####2019 SACNAS - The National Diversity in STEM Conference, Honolulu

Workshop attendees will be introduced to practical examples of how genomic data is used in research and clinical applications, highlighting techniques, technologies, and platforms used in genomic analysis. The current state of genomic science will be discussed, with emphasis on large scale sequencing projects of [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov) involving hundreds of thousands of individuals ([CCDG](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Common-Disease-Genomics), [CMG](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Mendelian-Genomics-CMG), [AnVIL](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL)).
