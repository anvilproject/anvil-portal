We are thrilled to announce the inaugural AnVIL Community Conference, taking place on November 12-13, 2024, in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. This event is a key event for professionals in the genomics community interested in biomedical and genomic cloud computing.

The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space (AnVIL) is revolutionizing genomic data science by providing a unified environment for data management, compute and collaboration. By eliminating the need for data movement and providing elastic, shared computing resources, AnVIL is setting new standards in the field.

The conference will feature:

- **Scientific Talks:** Engage with speakers including Anshul Kundaje, Michael Schatz, Tychele Turner and Melissa Wilson, demonstrating the latest advancements on the AnVIL platform.
- **Workshop:** Participate in a training led by the AnVIL team, offering a mix of presentations and hands-on instruction.
- **CoFest:** Collaborate and innovate during our Collaboration Fest, with participants sharing their discoveries at the close of the conference.

Join us at the flagship AnVIL Community Conference for an enriching blend of instruction and collaboration, set amidst the backdrop of cutting-edge scientific discourse.
