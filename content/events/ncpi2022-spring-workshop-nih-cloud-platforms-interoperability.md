### Description

First organized in 2019, the NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) Effortâ€™s goal is to establish and implement guidelines and technical standards to empower end-user analyses across the four participating platforms and facilitate the realization of a trans-NIH, federated data ecosystem. NCPI is a collaborative project between five NIH Institutes and Centers (NCI, NHGRI, NHLBI, NIH Common Fund, and NCBI) as well as external partners comprising six Working Groups: Coordination, Community Governance, FHIR, Outreach and Training, NIH Systems Interoperation, and Search.

This workshop will be open to the public and held on 22-23 June, 2022 from 11:00 AM - 4:00 PM EDT. We hope this meeting will be engaging to presenters and participants alike, providing guidance and vision to drive interoperability of NIH Cloud Platforms.

The meeting will comprise five main sessions of speakers, outlined below. Following the talks on each day, moderated breakout sessions will be opened to allow for community discussion and input.

- FAIR Data, Computing, Cataloging Resources Across the NIH and Global Communities: The vision shared in this session will provide foundation and direction to chart the collaborative future of NCPI.
- Panel Discussion with Commercial Cloud Vendors.
- Interoperability Driven Science: Cloud platform interoperability enables scientific discovery. Here we will learn of the latest advances in NCPI demonstration projects.
- NCPI Working Group Updates
- Technical Aspects of Interoperability: Technologies that enable interoperability are important to develop with stakeholders involved to promote the usability of the technical standards and products. In this session, we will hear about technologies enabling interoperability and their successful implementations in research.
