#### Description
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) provides more than 1800 R packages for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. Most users install and run Bioconductor on a personal computer or perhaps use an academic cluster. Cloud-based solutions are increasing appealing, removing the headaches of local installation while providing access to (a) better, scalable computing resources; and (b) large-scale 'consortium' and other reference data sets. This session introduces the AnVIL cloud computing environment. We cover: 

* use of the cloud as replacement to desktop-style computing,
* integrating workflows for 'upstream' processing of large data resources with interactive 'downstream' analysis and comprehension, using [Human Cell Atlas](https://data.humancellatlas.org) single-cell datasets as an example, and
* querying cloud-based consortium data for integration with a users' own data sets. 


#### Prerequisites
* Participants should be comfortable working with R and RStudio.
* Some familiarity with Bioconductor is helpful but not required.
* No prior cloud-based experience is necessary.
* A wifi enabled laptop with RStudio installed.

#### Duration
