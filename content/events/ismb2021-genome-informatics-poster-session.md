### Description

The 2021 Genome Informatics Meeting will cover topics including Microbial and Metagenomics; Sequencing Algorithms, Variant Discovery and Genome Assembly; Evolution, Complex Traits and Phylogenetics; Functional Genomics; Single Cell Genomics; and Epigenetics and Genome Structure.

During the workshop poster sessions, members of the AnVIL team will present work to profile and analyze the cloud costs for many of the most widely used tools & workflows in genomics with the aim to develop a predictive model and API that can estimate the costs for running these analyses on each of the major cloud platforms.
