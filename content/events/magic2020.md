### Description
An introduction to the AnVIL platform to enable CCDG and CMG researchers to analyze GSP data using AnVIL tools. Participants will gain exposure and familiarity with available data, tools, workflows, training materials, and support channels of AnVIL. Participants will not become bioinformatic experts, but will know what to do or who to contact when the time comes.

### Background
In summer 2020, NHGRI plans to organize Massive Genome Informatics in the Cloud or MaGIC, a two-day, jamboree-style informatics event for introducing new users to the AnVIL platform for cloud-based genomics data analysis.

### Audience
No computational expertise is required. Anyone from GSP who would like to learn about cloud based genomic analysis on AnVIL. This Jamboree will focus on highlighting interactive tools that are used from a graphical user interface.

### Registration
Registration is required. Register here: <http://tiny.cc/registration2020magicjam>
