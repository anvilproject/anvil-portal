<span>As part of new federal government security policies, Terra is required to integrate with the NIH Researcher Authentication Service (RAS) for identity proofing and enhanced security. In order to link your NIH authorization to Terra, users of eRA Commons must transition to the use of [Login.gov](https://login.gov) or ID.me credentials to access AnVIL controlled-access data in Terra. See [here](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/32634034451099-RAS-Integration-for-AnVIL-Data) for more details and instructions.</span>
