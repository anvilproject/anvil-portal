# Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases

The GREGoR Consortium (Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases) seeks to discover the cause of currently unexplained Mendelian genetic disorders through the application and standardization of new omic technologies and diagnostic approaches.
