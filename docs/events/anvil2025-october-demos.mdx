## Introducing the All of Us and AnVIL Imputation Service

### 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM ET – Demo on AnVIL

Learn how to use the [All of Us + AnVIL Imputation Service](https://allofus-anvil-imputation.terra.bio/), a tool for increasing the number of variants in population studies. This presentation will discuss the motivation behind creating this new service, scientific validation demonstrating higher imputation accuracy across ancestries, and how to use the new imputation service portal as well as the command-line tool to impute your data.

### 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM ET – Q&A

We’ll open up the floor to questions about the demo presented, and will have AnVIL and Terra support on call to answer any questions about AnVIL you might have!

## What are AnVIL Demos?

AnVIL Demos are a series of virtual meetings that highlight what you can do on the [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL), a cloud-based computing platform for genomic data science. AnVIL Demos will start out with a 30-minute demonstration on the platform followed by open time for Q&A and user support.

In the demos, presenters will highlight anything from a capability of the platform to a scientific analysis powered by AnVIL. If you’re interested in showcasing how you use AnVIL at a future AnVIL Demos session, reach out to [Natalie Kucher]({natalieKucher}).

After the demo, we’ll open up the floor to answer questions about the demo and to answer any other questions you might have about AnVIL.
