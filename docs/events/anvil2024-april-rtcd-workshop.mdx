<EventsHero {...frontmatter} />

Are you interested in data and computational sciences?

Do you want to learn about analyzing large genomic datasets in the cloud?

Do you have some basic skills in python, R, or Galaxy?

The AnVIL team will host an in-person AnVIL workshop on Sunday, April 7, 2024 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM PT. During the 3-hour workshop, participants learn about the AnVIL platform, a secure cloud-based platform that enables genomic data analysis at scale. AnVIL includes a number of analysis environments and platforms, including Galaxy, Bioconductor, and WDL Workflows. The workshop will feature hands-on demos to understand how to navigate in the platform, access and share data, and use some of the analysis tools in AnVIL.

Only open access data will be used, so participants will be able to access each dataset and analysis. Participants will be able to ask questions and interact with the presenters throughout the workshop. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a better understanding of how to use AnVIL for their genomic data analysis needs.

## Audience

This workshop is designed for attendees of the NHGRI Research Training and Career Development Annual Meeting in Seattle, WA on April 7-9, 2024. Learn more [here](https://rsvp.duke.edu/event/7a1ed40e-1fb1-4ba0-82cd-3111c6b8891f/websitePage:44bda761-270d-48be-b519-319929756d8e). The target audience is about 30 hands-on participants with basic analysis familiarity.

## Prerequisites

If you are interested in this workshop, please register using ([this form](https://bit.ly/rtcd2024-anvil)) by February 15. In order to maximize opportunities for interaction with our instructors, we may prioritize participant selection based on the following:

1. Immediate or anticipated need for computing resources.
2. Diversity of institutional affiliation and career stage representation.

Participants will be selected and notified by February 23.

Material is targeted towards analysts who have a basic familiarity working with sequencing data (working with common genomic sequencing output file types, running tools on sequencing output files like quality control or assembly, or visualizing analysis results). Cloud credits will be provided for participants for the workshop. To be connected, you will need to create a free AnVIL account. If you do not already have an AnVIL account please register for one using [this guide](https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_Getting_Started/overview-analysts.html) (it will take approximately 10-15 minutes to register).

Box dinner to be provided to all attendees.

In case you are interested, but not selected, a number of resources are available to help you learn about the platform. The introductory video below is a great place to start.
