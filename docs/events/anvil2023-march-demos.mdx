## What are AnVIL Demos?

Join us to see a highlight of what you can do on AnVIL! AnVIL Demos will start out with a 30-minute demonstration on the platform followed by open time for Q&A and user support.

In the demos, presenters will highlight anything from a capability of the platform to a scientific analysis powered by AnVIL. If you’re interested in showcasing how you use AnVIL at a future AnVIL Demos session, reach out to [Natalie Kucher]({natalieKucher}).

After the demo, we’ll open up the floor to answer any questions about the demo and to answer any general questions you might have about AnVIL.
