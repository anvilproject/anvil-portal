<EventsHero {...frontmatter} />

We are thrilled to announce the inaugural AnVIL Community Conference, taking place on November 12-13, 2024, in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. This event is a key event for professionals in the genomics community interested in biomedical and genomic cloud computing.

The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space (AnVIL) is revolutionizing genomic data science by providing a unified environment for data management, compute and collaboration. By eliminating the need for data movement and providing elastic, shared computing resources, AnVIL is setting new standards in the field.

The conference will feature:

- **Scientific Talks:** Engage with speakers including Anshul Kundaje, Benedict Paten, Michael Schatz, and Tychele Turner, demonstrating the latest advancements on the AnVIL platform.
- **CoFest!**: Collaborate and innovate during our Collaboration Fest, with participants sharing their discoveries at the close of the conference.

Join us at the flagship AnVIL Community Conference for an enriching blend of instruction and collaboration, set amidst the backdrop of cutting-edge scientific discourse.

We look forward to seeing you there!

### CoFests! and Topics

AnVIL collaborative events are emphatically called CollaborationFests! rather than Hackathons. Putting Collaboration in the name emphasizes what the events are about for us, and Fest communicates that they are fun events (which they are).

‚ÄúHackathon‚Äù implies an emphasis on code. CoFests! are about contributing and learning how to contribute to all aspects of AnVIL, including training material, community infrastructure, documentation, unit tests, bug reports, and yes, even code. First and foremost AnVIL CoFests! are about growing the community of future contributors.

This year's CoFests! topics are listed below: 
- Deploying, Training, and Interpreting Deep Learning Models for regulatory genomics in AnVIL (Led by: Anshul Kundaje & Vivek Ramalingam, Stanford University)
- Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Analysis in AnVIL (Led by: Matthew Lebo, Harvard Medical School)
- How to Run Your Tool in AnVIL with WDL (Led by: Allie Cliffe, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard)
- Brainstorming Feature Requests for AnVIL (Led by: Ava Hoffman, Fred Hutch Cancer Center / AnVIL Outreach)
