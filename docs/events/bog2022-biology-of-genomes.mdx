The 33rd annual meeting on The Biology of Genomes will begin at 7:30 pm on Tuesday, May 10, 2022 and run through lunch on Saturday, May 14. The 2022 meeting will address DNA sequence variation and its role in molecular evolution, population genetics and complex diseases, comparative genomics, large-scale studies of gene and protein expression, and genomic approaches to ecological systems. Both technologies and applications will be emphasized. There will be a special session on the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research as well as a session dedicated to helping trainees and early career researchers successfully navigate the NIH funding process.
