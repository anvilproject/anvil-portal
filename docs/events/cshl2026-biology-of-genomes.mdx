The AnVIL team will attend the CSHL Genome Informatics meeting to share about the AnVIL platform with the genomics community. This meeting will draw together researchers focused on genomic data science research, for which AnVIL can be a useful platform to leverage and can offer solutions to some common challenges in the field.

## Background

The 39th annual meeting on Biology of Genomes will begin at 7:30 pm on Tuesday, May 5, 2026, and run through lunch on Saturday, May 9.

The 2026 meeting will address DNA sequence variation and its role in molecular evolution, population genetics, complex diseases, comparative genomics, large-scale studies of gene and protein expression, and genomic approaches to ecological systems. Both technologies and applications will be emphasized. In addition, there will be a special session on the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genome research.

Topics:

- Population Genomics
- Evolutionary & Non-human Genomics
- Cancer Genomics
- Computational & Statistical Genomics
- Complex Traits & Genomic Medicine
- Functional Genomics
- Emerging Methods & Technologies
