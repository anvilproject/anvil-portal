## Organizers

- Tuuli Lappalainen, New York Genome Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology & SciLife Lab
- Matthew Meyerson, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
- Aaron Quinlan, University of Utah
- Jenny Tung, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology & Duke University

The 38th annual meeting on Biology of Genomes will begin at 7:30 pm on Tuesday, May 6, 2025, and run through lunch on Saturday, May 10.

The 2025 meeting will address DNA sequence variation and its role in molecular evolution, population genetics, complex diseases, comparative genomics, large-scale studies of gene and protein expression, and genomic approaches to ecological systems. Both technologies and applications will be emphasized. In addition, there will be a special session on the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genome research.

**Financial Support**: The James P. Taylor Foundation for Open Science will award six scholarships covering full conference registration to outstanding graduate students. Online application will open soon.
