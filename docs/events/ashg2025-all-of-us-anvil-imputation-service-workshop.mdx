<EventsHero {...frontmatter} />

The NIH’s All of Us Research Program and NHGRI’s Genomic Analysis Visualization and Informatics Lab Space (AnVIL) are collaborating to build an imputation service, backed by the largest imputation panel in the world. The panel is derived from whole genome data of over 515,000 participants, including more than 250,000 from non-European ancestries. Attendees will hear about the development of the service, learn to submit data to the service for imputation, and perform a down stream analysis calculating a polygenic risk score on data imputed with the service.

Participants will be provided with a test vcf to submit to the service, and will be instructed in the use of a dedicated command line tool for interacting with the service. PRS calculation will be performed using PLINK.
