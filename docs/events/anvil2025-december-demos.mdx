## What are AnVIL Demos?

AnVIL Demos are a series of virtual meetings that highlight what you can do on the [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL), a cloud-based computing platform for genomic data science. AnVIL Demos will start out with a 30-minute demonstration on the platform followed by open time for Q&A and user support.

In the demos, presenters will highlight anything from a capability of the platform to a scientific analysis powered by AnVIL. If you’re interested in showcasing how you use AnVIL at a future AnVIL Demos session, reach out to [Natalie Kucher]({natalieKucher}).

View our past AnVIL Demos on our YouTube playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6aYJ_0zJ4uC978C57P3TgAAfB38uy58E).

After the demo, we’ll open up the floor to answer questions about the demo and to answer any other questions you might have about AnVIL.
