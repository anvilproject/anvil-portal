### Community Forum

The Community Forum was an open opportunity for a full audience discussion on any topics of interest to the community. The discussion spanned compliance with new federal data security guidelines, sustainability in community support, functionality to display summary-level results, engagement with a broader set of communities, and requirements of data access for potential researchers not connected to a dbGaP recognized institution.

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVJirnOVxCQ"/>

The key takeaways from the community session were:

- AnVIL is compliant with the new NIH guidelines for secure storage of controlled access datasets (NOT-OD-24-157), meeting the NIST SP 800-171, and AnVIL serves as a good place for controlled access data storage. However, the administrative process with institutions and signing officials to trust & adopt AnVIL is not yet clear. There are educational and awareness needs to support institutions in embracing cloud-first and AnVIL.
  - The AnVIL team also will be attending conferences like NCURA and ASHG to connect with and share information with administrative personnel on how to rely on AnVIL, as well as developing materials to support researchers to understand this.
- AnVIL’s userbase is growing and the team is eager to sustain user support for a growing community. 
  - The team relies on training trainers and building up community members to scale support and knowledge sharing among users. Over time, users posting their publications, publicizing their workflows through Dockstore and other resources, asking their questions on the Support Forum - all contribute to a rich resource ecosystem where users are able to learn from previous work, like we see in the Galaxy and Bioconductor communities.
  - Developing Featured Workspaces as gold standard examples of data organization, analysis, and sharing will help contribute to this resource.
  - Seeding the community with users who are able to engage deeply and encouraging them to use all the functions and features of AnVIL will grow up a community around these users’ or consortia’s resources, and highlight to other groups the advantages of using AnVIL.
- Users were interested in exploring more ways to share results and summarized results and statistics (e..g, beyond a GWAS). This functionality has been developed by groups in different ways, primarily the AnVIL team has seen users use the Workspace Dashboard space to share some results details or develop shiny apps that enable researchers to interact with an interface to explore data.
  - There are a number of large biobanks that have done phenome or genome wide summaries, and users have a challenge interacting with the massive summary files. Each of these often comes with its own browser, but it’s challenging to look across these resources, and this could be an opportunity for AnVIL.
  - AnVIL doesn’t currently support persistent user interfaces or multi-tenant apps, though these would enable some features folks are interested in.
  - AnVIL holds legacy datasets from NHGRI consortia which are in process of going through harmonization to improve its utility and reusability.
- The community was interested to engage less traditional potential researchers on AnVIL (e.g., high school students, medical librarians, general public). The team has had focused efforts with the Genomic Data Science Community Network from a wide range of institutions R1s to Community Colleges and beyond. There have been efforts to engage with international communities as well with a virtual workshop in Sri Lanka in January 2025. 
  - A challenge is that cloud compute credits can be offered for a limited time, and it can be difficult to empower these groups when credits are used or the offering period expires.
  - Another challenge is that users require backing by a recognized institution to be able to access controlled-access datasets. There are over 1.2 PB of non-restricted access datasets, which can be a very valuable resource for students & citizen scientists.
  - AnVIL follows the mandate to protect participants’ data in accordance with their consent and aims to make data access and reuse more available to a broad set of researchers and potential researchers. The community is supportive of NIH and dbGaP, which manage these controls, to explore broadening methods of data access for students.

#### Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Analysis in AnVIL

Scientific Lead: Matthew Lebo, PhD & Shruti Parpattedar, MS, Harvard Medical School\
Outreach Coordinator: Elizabeth Humphries, PhD, Fred Hutch Cancer Center

This track, run by the AnVIL Clinical Resource team, consisted of both an overview and a hands-on workshop to provide individuals with an understanding of polygenic scores and how to run and evaluate them in AnVIL. First, we level-set by providing an overview of the current state of polygenic analysis, with a focus on polygenic risk scores (PRS). Next, we jointly worked with participants to run PRS mix analyses in AnVIL using the WDL framework. These tasks increased in complexity in terms of analytical components of the workflow, with the goal of enabling users to run the WDL on their own. We also engaged with participants to get feedback and create user-friendly documents to enable processing of this workflow once published to the broader community. 

The key takeaways from this session were:

- Learned about Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) and Polygenic Score (PGS) Catalogue.
- Learned about PRS mix scores and how to calculate them.
- Learned how to run a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) WDL workflow on AnVIL.
- Lots of tracking and troubleshooting.

#### AnVIL Mini Hack: Reproducibility in Action!

Scientific Lead: Allissa Dillman, BioDataSage, Montgomery College\
Outreach Coordinator: Kate Isaac, Fred Hutch Cancer Center

Reproducibility can be deceptively challenging in computational genomics. In this hands-on mini-hackathon, participants explored the intricacies of reproducing figures from the MAGE RNA sequencing study using real omics data from the 1000 Genomes Project and MAGE. Teams were encouraged not only to recreate published figures but also to design new visualizations from these open datasets. The session emphasized that computational reproducibility requires creativity, problem-solving, and detective work beyond simply following protocols.

The key takeaways for this session were:

- Hands-on experience with cloud-based tools on AnVIL to explore and reproduce RNA-seq analyses.
- Gained familiarity with public datasets from the MAGE and 1000 Genomes datasets.
- Learned best practices for managing and organizing analysis in an AnVIL workspace.
- Developed problem-solving skills for interpreting published results and creating new visualizations from open data.
