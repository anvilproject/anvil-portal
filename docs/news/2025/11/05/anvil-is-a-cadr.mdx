The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) has been formally recognized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a [Controlled-Access Data Repository](https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/sharing-policies/accessing-data/requirements) (CADR). This designation affirms NIH’s confidence in AnVIL as a secure, compliant environment for human genomic research and highlights its alignment with NIH’s evolving data security and sharing standards. The recognition reflects new NIH documentation defining AnVIL as a trusted platform for accessing and analyzing controlled-access data under the Required Security and Operational Standards for NIH Controlled-Access Data Repositories ([NOT-OD-25-159](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-159.html)).

AnVIL operates as a federally certified secure environment for human genomic data, trusted across NIH. It meets the NIST SP 800-171 security standards required for controlled-access data as of [NOT-OD-24-157](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24-157.html) and holds an official Authority to Operate (ATO) as a FISMA Moderate-impact system. In addition, AnVIL is FedRAMP authorized at the Moderate level, providing researchers with certified compliance and rigorous operational oversight at no additional cost.

As the NIH-designated data repository for NHGRI-funded genomic datasets ([NOT-HG-24-020](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HG-24-020.html)), AnVIL offers a seamless and secure cloud platform for analyzing controlled-access data. Researchers can [import data directly from dbGaP and other NIH repositories into AnVIL’s protected environment](https://anvilproject.org/learn/find-data/importing-data-from-dbgap-and-sra)—eliminating the need to download sensitive datasets to local infrastructure.

By combining robust cloud security, NIH-approved compliance, and integrated tools for large-scale analysis, AnVIL enables researchers to focus on discovery while meeting updated standards for responsible data stewardship.
