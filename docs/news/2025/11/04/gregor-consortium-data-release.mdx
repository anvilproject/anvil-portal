The fourth data release from the [GREGoR Consortium](https://gregorconsortium.org) (Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare diseases) is now available on AnVIL for controlled access by the broader scientific community. Additionally, the GREGoR Consortium has developed a publicly available open-access [variant browser](https://variants.gregorconsortium.org) that enables searches for variants of interest across the Consortium joint, short-read whole genome callset.

Access requests for these controlled datasets are available through dbGaP under accession [phs003047](http://google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id%3Dphs003047.v3.p2%23attribution-section&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1761841465946788&usg=AOvVaw1vvLHSCdb3mxlJ6M-hOKj9) and the data is available at https://explore.anvilproject.org/datasets or https://duos.org/datalibrary/anvil.

The GREGoR Consortium has assembled a dataset of broad utility. All participants are broadly consented for General Research Use or Health, Medical, or Biomedical research. The Consortium data aligns with [the GREGoR Data Model](https://github.com/UW-GAC/gregor_data_models), designed to provide context and information to support analysis and secondary use of the data. Additional documentation, including how to apply for access, is available on the GREGoR Consortium’s [Data webpage](https://gregorconsortium.org/data).

This fourth data release contains data from 10,683 participants in 4,366 families. For these participants, the GREGoR Consortium Dataset includes family, pedigree and phenotype information. Genomic data, such as short-read DNA and RNA sequencing data, are available for the majority of GREGoR participants (see table below). The GREGoR Dataset also includes candidate genetic findings identified by participating [GREGoR Research Centers](https://gregorconsortium.org/about/gregor-centers). In this release, a subset of short-read whole genome sequencing data is uniformly processed by the GREGoR Data Coordinating Center, which is used to generate a Consortium joint callset for small variants (SNVs and Indels).
