## The OurHealth Study – Discovering the Causes Behind High Rates of Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes in South Asians

![OurHealth Study](/consortia/news/ourhealth-release.webp)

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a life-changing and often frightening condition—one that weighs heavily on the global South Asian community. Many South Asians either have been directly affected by heart disease or know someone who has. Yet, despite South Asians constituting nearly a quarter of the world’s population, they remain significantly underrepresented in genetic studies and clinical trials.

### Why South Asians Face Higher CVD Risk

Studies have shown that South Asians (defined here as individuals with ancestry from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, or Sri Lanka) experience higher rates of cardiovascular events, often at younger ages than other ethnic groups. Both the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recognize South Asian ancestry as a “risk-enhancing factor” for CVD. As medicine strives to move away from broad race-based classifications, this designation underscores how little we truly understand about the precise mechanisms of disease risk in South Asian populations.

Research shows that people with Bangladeshi or Pakistani heritage face particularly high rates of heart disease, relative even to those with Indian ancestry—hinting at genetic and cultural differences that remain poorly understood. While certain drivers of risk (diet, stress, and lack of physical activity) are well established, the underrepresentation of South Asians in genetic studies (just 1% of participants to date) means we still have much to learn about how genomics, environment, and lifestyle interact to increase heart disease susceptibility.

### The Opportunity of Remote Studies

One of the most promising ways to address this research gap is through national initiatives utilizing remote platforms to expand the reach to more communities and reduce participant burden. These studies can better reflect the real-world diversity of the diaspora, ensuring findings—and future treatments—are more robust and inclusive.

### How can you help? Join the [OurHealth Study](https://ourhealthstudy.org)

The OurHealth study is leading the way to better understand the complexities of CVD within the South Asian diaspora by merging genetic research with lifestyle and environmental factors. The study aims to:

- **Discover and characterize genetic and non-genetic drivers** of cardiovascular and other health risks among South Asians in the U.S. We are also in the early stages of building a new sub-study that aims to return your personalized genomic risk score for heart disease to you when you participate.
- **Offer culturally relevant health information** for cardiovascular health, recognizing the diverse dietary and lifestyle practices within the community. 
- **Maintain bi-directional communication** with participants, ensuring ongoing engagement and the potential for further data collection.

So far, **2,000 participants** have enrolled, and **1100 saliva samples** have been collected since the study’s launch in October 2023, **but we need your help to build a dataset of 10,000 participant samples** that will effectively allow us to conduct a meaningful analysis.

### Known Risk Factors Beyond Genetics

While genetics are a crucial piece of the puzzle, lifestyle and environmental factors play a major role in the elevated cardiovascular risk among South Asians:

- **Diet**: Traditional South Asian diets can be high in refined carbohydrates, sugars, and fats. Over time, these dietary patterns contribute to obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
- **Lack of Physical Activity**: Stressors linked to immigration, work, and cultural norms often leave less room for exercise, further compounding disease risk.
- **Obesity and Abdominal Fat**: Even at a normal BMI, South Asians frequently accumulate visceral fat around the abdomen, increasing insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease risk.
- **High Blood Pressure**: South Asians develop hypertension at higher rates than many other ethnic groups, further amplifying heart disease risk.

### Evidence-Based Tips for Heart Health

The good news is that many of these risks can be mitigated with proactive steps:

- **Heart-Healthy Diet**: Opt for whole grains over refined carbohydrates, low- or non-fat dairy over high-fat versions, and reduce added sugars.
- **Increased Physical Activity**: Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (e.g., brisk walking, dancing, biking) per week, along with enjoyable pursuits like gardening or casual sports.
- **Stress Management**: Incorporate mindfulness, meditation, or breathing exercises into your routine to help reduce stress-related poor dietary choices.
- **Regular Screenings**: Monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels to catch warning signs early and prevent disease progression.

The first release of **OurHealth data is now available on AnVIL** and includes self-reported basic demographics, anthropometric traits, cardiometabolic outcomes, and Blended Genome-Exome (BGE) sequencing data on 621 study participants. To access individual-level OurHealth data, submit a Data Access Request for [phs003821](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003821) via [dbGaP](https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/sharing-policies/accessing-data/dbgap). The OurHealth data aligns with the [PRIMED Data Model](https://github.com/UW-GAC/primed_data_models). Future releases of OurHealth data will include additional phenotypes and BGE data on over 1,000 study participants. Funding for BGE sequencing and analyses are provided through the NIH-funded Polygenic Risk Methods Development ([PRIMED](https://primedconsortium.org)) Consortium (U01HG011719 and U01HG011697; see the [OurHealth Acknowledgements and attribution statement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003821#attribution-section)).
