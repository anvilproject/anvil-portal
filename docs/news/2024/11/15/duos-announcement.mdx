AnVIL is excited to announce the addition of 257 datasets to the AnVIL Data Library, accessible at https://duos.org/datalibrary/AnVIL. These datasets, hosted in AnVILâ€™s cloud storage, allow researchers to explore and request access to rich genomic data, advancing the scope of scientific inquiry and collaboration within the community.

Each dataset in the AnVIL Data Library is designed to be searchable, with tailored options for researchers to navigate, locate, and request the specific data they need including search by data use permissions. The platform leverages the Data Use Oversight System (DUOS), a streamlined access tool that expedites data request, review, and access, ensuring researchers can obtain the data they need more efficiently. 

We encourage researchers to visit the library, explore available resources, and request access to datasets to support their ongoing projects and discoveries.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to expand the AnVIL Data Library with more datasets available to the research community.
