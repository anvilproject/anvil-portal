**We are excited to announce the availability of GTEx V10 data on the AnVIL platform!**

The GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) consortium has just released version 10 of its comprehensive dataset, advancing research on human gene expression and its regulation across tissues. This release offers a wealth of new resources for the research community:

**What's New in GTEx V10?**

- **Expanded RNA-seq Data:** V10 includes 12% more RNA-seq samples than the previous V8 release.
- **Enhanced eQTL Analyses:** Researchers can now access 23% more samples used in eQTL analyses.
- **Small RNA-seq Data:** V10 introduces smallRNA-seq data from 16,760 tissue samples, including gene expression counts and cis-QTLs.
- **Deep Somatic Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS):** High-coverage (~195X) somatic WGS data from 199 samples, spanning 5-7 tissue types from 55 donors, are now available.
- **Genotyping of All Adult Donors:** While this data was initially included in V9, it complements the wealth of V10 data for broader integrative analyses.

**Accessing GTEx V10 Data on AnVIL**

Researchers can now access GTEx V10 controlled access data through the **AnVIL platform**, which also provides cloud-based infrastructure for scalable genomics analysis. GTEx V10 open access data is also available for download via the [GTEx Open Access Download page](https://gtexportal.org/home/home/news?id=520).

For access to controlled data, including individual-level genotypes and phenotypes:

- **Request access through dbGaP:** The GTEx dataset can be found on dbGaP under accession [phs000424.v10.p1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v10.p2).
- **Leverage DUOS for streamlined access:** Researchers can also utilize the [Data Use Oversight System (DUOS)](https://duos.org/home) to request and manage access to GTEx data, ensuring compliance with data use agreements efficiently. Step-by-step instructions to access GTEx data for analysis in Terra can be found here: [https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/30873545719451-How-to-access-GTEx-data-in-Terra](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/30873545719451-How-to-access-GTEx-data-in-Terra)  

**We invite researchers to explore GTEx V10 on the AnVIL platform and take advantage of its cutting-edge resources to drive new discoveries in genomics.**
