The updated [NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24-157.html) mandates that starting January 25, 2025, researchers using NIH controlled-access data must store and analyze it on [NIST SP 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/final) (or equivalent) compliant systems.

AnVIL, powered by [Terra](https://terra.bio/terra-details/), already meets these security requirements, providing a ready-made solution for researchers and institutions.

For more information on how AnVIL and Terra help researchers comply with the updated requirements, please see [Are you compliant with NIHâ€™s updated Genomic Data Sharing policy? Terra can help!](https://terra.bio/nihs-updated-genomic-data-sharing-policy/)
