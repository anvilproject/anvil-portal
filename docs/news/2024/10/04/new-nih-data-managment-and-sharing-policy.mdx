Over the past two decades, technological advances and projects like the Human Genome Project have led to an explosion in genomics data, prompting the NIH to strengthen data-sharing practices through policies like the NIH's new [Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy).

The AnVIL platform, funded by [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/), offers secure cloud-native tools and comprehensive support to help researchers meet DMS Policy requirements while contributing to a federated ecosystem of over 10 petabytes of [NIH-funded data](https://explore.anvilproject.org/datasets).

For more information on how the AnVIL platform, powered by Terra, helps research meet the new DMS Policy, please see [AnVIL platform helps meet the new NIH Data Management and Sharing policy requirements](https://terra.bio/anvil-platform-helps-meet-the-new-nih-data-management-and-sharing-policy-requirements/).
