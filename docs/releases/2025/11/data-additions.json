    "releaseNotes": "This IGVF consortium data release encompasses both human and mouse single-cell genome and transcriptome studies. The human component comprises 95 single-cell multiome or single-cell RNA sequencing studies featuring 89 biological samples derived from 50 human donors across 4 distinct tissue/organ types. The release includes Illumina single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, along with downstream analyses characterizing chromatin states, transcriptome, transcription factor activity, and mitochondrial DNA across diverse biological contexts. The mouse component consists of 309 datasets generated using Illumina and Nanopore single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, representing 16 different tissue and organ types collected from 183 mice spanning 16 distinct strains. The release also provides comprehensive cell type annotations across strains and tissues/organs based on the single-cell RNA sequencing data.",
