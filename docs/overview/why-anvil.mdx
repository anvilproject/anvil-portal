**Amount of data on AnVIL**:

As discussed in the [flagship AnVIL paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(21)00106-3), the AnVIL hosts data from >280,000 human genomes from >240 different cohorts spanning multiple consortia and major NHGRI projects. The AnVIL offers a browsable catalog of summary information about all of the datasets so that even if a user isn't authorized to access the data itself, they can better determine if the data will be helpful for their research if they need to apply for authorization for access. AnVIL is working to facilitate data harmonization across studies, ensuring consistency and interoperability, which is critical for large-scale analyses. These efforts will increase the value of the AnVIL data and maximize its utility to the researcher community.

### Data & analysis in same place

![The AnVIL portal is an entry point for all parts of the AnVIL with documentation and announcements. The home page of the portal is shown](/consortia/overview/images/why_anvil_portal_home.png)

AnVIL is a unified computing environment for data storage, management, and analysis. The [AnVIL portal](https://anvilproject.org) serves as an entry point to access all parts of the AnVIL system as well as training materials and announcements.

### Scalability

AnVIL is conducive to analysis at massive scale and for data exploration and training. Researchers get access to dedicated compute resources, avoiding queue time and lack of access at some institutions. Researchers can also launch light environments or run test analyses without incurring much cost or spending a lot of time to configure.

### Rent needed resources

Since AnVIL handles the support and maintenance of the platform (including the hardware and software), you can focus on performing your work on AnVIL rather than setting up and maintaining the platform, freeing up effort for your science. This is immensely valuable for researchers who do not have deep institutional IT and system administrator support for research infrastructure.

### Role-based permissions

![A workspace is the fundamental unit of activity in AnVIL with role-based access. An example workspace is shown with the access level or role highlighted](/consortia/overview/images/why_anvil_workspace_roles.png)

[Group management](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360022704371-Navigating-in-Terra) can be utilized to control who can access specific data, analysis workspaces, and your billing resources. [Workspaces provide a collaborative environment](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) with role-based permissions. These [permission include reading, writing, or owning with additional permissions for running compute and sharing](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360025851892-Sharing-data-and-tools-with-workspace-access-controls). Especially within the contexts of working with sensitive data or large amounts of data, AnVIL's role-based group management permission structure is instrumental.

### Shareable workspaces

![A workspace can be a shareable record of analyses. An example worksapce is shown with options to share the workspace through its permalink highlighted](/consortia/overview/images/why_anvil_workspace_share.png)

[Workspaces](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) can contain data, metadata, and analysis tools, as well as documentation and history of workflow runs, additionally displaying important information such as when the workspace was created and last modified. AnVIL workspaces on the web can serve as shareable, reproducible records of analyses. Research conducted on the AnVIL platform has contributed to over 115 scientific publications citing the AnVIL paper, demonstrating its role in advancing genomic and biomedical research.

### Repository compliant with DMS Policy

The AnVIL serves as a [cloud data repository compliant with the Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy](/overview/dms-requirements). Data access controls can be specified to limit data access and use.

By submitting their data to AnVIL, not only can researchers meet the requirements of DMS Policy, they can also [contribute to the expanding network of NIH funded data housed in the AnVIL](https://terra.bio/anvil-platform-helps-meet-the-new-nih-data-management-and-sharing-policy-requirements/), furthering scientific discovery.

<Alert icon={false} severity="info">
<div>
**What is DMS Policy?**

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Data Management and Sharing (DMS) policy requires that all NIH-supported research which generates [scientific data](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html#scientific-data) (barring ethical, legal, or technical factors [limiting data sharing](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html#when-to-not-share)) must create a plan and budget for data management and sharing.

While some funding announcements for some research may specify which repository should be used to comply with DMS policy, mostly the NIH does not specify [where data should be stored.](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/data-management-and-storage.html#data-repositories). The NIH does provide an [interactive table listing NIH supported data repositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/repositories-for-sharing-scientific-data) than can be used and [suggests that researchers use a repository most appropriate for the data generated from their research](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/selecting-a-data-repository).
