{/*
  Image outlining this section of research benefits
*/}

### Ease of platform access

The primary means of accessing the AnVIL platform ([anvil.terra.bio](https://anvil.terra.bio/)) is through a web browser - users do not need to download data or install software.

<details>
  <summary>Accessing AnVIL beyond the web browser</summary>

  The platform ([anvil.terra.bio](https://anvil.terra.bio/)) provides a variety of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to interact with data, analysis solutions, and workflows. Bioconductor packages ([AnVIL](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/AnVIL/inst/doc/Introduction.html), [AnVILGCP](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnVILGCP.html), [AnVILWorkflow](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnVILWorkflow.html)) offer additional methods for users to programmatically interact with and access AnVIL resources from within AnVIL, or stand-alone computing environments such as a user's laptop.

</details>

### Variety of analysis solutions

{/*
  Image showing compute options
*/}

AnVIL supports an assortment of frameworks and tools. Researchers can use their favorite tool to work with data interactively or through non-interactive batch processing. Due to this variety and interoperability with other platforms, researchers can stay within a single environment for their analysis without having to shift between platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Interactive sessions</summary>

  Interactive sessions are available with Jupyter, RStudio/Bioconductor, and Galaxy.

  Use of Galaxy on AnVIL enables even more customizability with the ability to [install specific tools/versions with Toolshed](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/4402392877979-Galaxy-on-Terra-FAQs#heading-12).

  For more information on the AnVIL project portal: [Interactive analyses](https://anvilproject.org/learn/run-interactive-analyses)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Non-interactive batch processing</summary>

  Workflows can be [user-supplied/written](https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_WDL/write-wdl.html#export-to-anvil-powered-by-terra-and-run) or [imported with Dockstore](https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_WDL/import-and-configure-workflows.html) and used to steer non-interactive pipelines and batch processing of data.

  For more information on the AnVIL project portal: [Analysis Workflows](https://anvilproject.org/learn/run-analyses-workflows)

</details>

### Data: yours or cloud-hosted open & controlled access

{/*
  Image showing data options
*/}

AnVIL securely stores diverse, open and controlled access, cloud-hosted datasets with a browsable summary catalog so researchers can identify relevant datasets they may need to request access to.

<details>
  <summary>Consortia Data on the AnVIL</summary>

  Data on the AnVIL includes data from consortia such as

    * [The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Compute Project](https://anvilproject.org/news/2023/09/05/data-release-als-compute-project)
    * [NIH Intramural Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias (CARD)](https://anvilproject.org/news/2023/03/17/data-release-card-dementia-long-read-project)
    * [The Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG)](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Common-Disease-Genomics)
    * [The Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG)](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Mendelian-Genomics-CMG)

    * [Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T)](https://anvilproject.org/news/2023/03/17/data-release-telomere-to-telomere)

  [Additional consortia or upcoming planned data ingestion can be found on the AnVIL project portal](https://anvilproject.org/consortia). By inverting the typical method of genomic analysis, AnVIL brings a computing environment to the data rather than moving the data from storage to the computing environment or stories copies of the data across institutional high performance computing clusters.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Amount of data on AnVIL</summary>

  As discussed in the [flagship AnVIL paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(21)00106-3), the AnVIL hosts data from >280,000 human genomes from >240 different cohorts spanning multiple consortia and major NHGRI projects. The AnVIL offers a browsable catalog of summary information about all of the datasets so that even if a user isn't authorized to access the data itself, they can better determine if the data will be helpful for their research if they need to apply for authorization for access. AnVIL is working to facilitate data harmonization across studies, ensuring consistency and interoperability, which is critical for large-scale analyses. These efforts will increase the value of the AnVIL data and maximize its utility to the researcher community.

### Data & analysis in same place

{/*
  Image showing AnVIL portal home
*/}

AnVIL is a unified computing environment for data storage, management, and analysis. The [AnVIL portal](https://anvilproject.org) serves as an entry point to access all parts of the AnVIL system as well as training materials and announcements.

### Scalability

AnVIL is conducive to analysis at massive scale and for data exploration and training. Researchers get access to dedicated compute resources, avoiding queue time and lack of access at some institutions. Researchers can also launch light environments or run test analyses without incurring much cost or spending a lot of time to configure.

### Rent needed resources

Since AnVIL handles the support and maintenance of the platform (including the hardware and software), you can focus on performing your work on AnVIL rather than setting up and maintaining the platform, freeing up effort for your science. This is immensely valuable for researchers who do not have deep institutional IT and system administrator support for research infrastructure.

### Role-based permissions

{/*
  Image showing workspace roles
*/}

[Group management](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360022704371-Navigating-in-Terra) can be utilized to control who can access specific data, analysis workspaces, and your billing resources. [Workspaces provide a collaborative environment](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) with role-based permissions. These [permission include reading, writing, or owning with additional permissions for running compute and sharing](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360025851892-Sharing-data-and-tools-with-workspace-access-controls). Especially within the contexts of working with sensitive data or large amounts of data, AnVIL's role-based group management permission structure is instrumental.

For more information on the AnVIL project portal: [Terra Workspaces](https://anvilproject.org/learn/run-analyses-workflows/intro-to-terra#understanding-terra-workspaces)

### Shareable workspaces

[Workspaces](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) can contain data, metadata, and analysis tools, as well as documentation and history of workflow runs, additionally displaying important information such as when the workspace was created and last modified. AnVIL workspaces on the web can serve as shareable, reproducible records of analyses. Research conducted on the AnVIL platform has contributed to over 115 scientific publications citing the AnVIL paper, demonstrating its role in advancing genomic and biomedical research.

</details>

### Repository compliant with DMS Policy

The AnVIL serves as a [cloud data repository compliant with the Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy](https://anvilproject.org/overview/dms-requirements). Data access controls can be specified to limit data access and use.

By submitting their data to AnVIL, not only can researchers meet the requirements of DMS Policy, they can also [contribute to the expanding network of NIH funded data housed in the AnVIL](https://terra.bio/anvil-platform-helps-meet-the-new-nih-data-management-and-sharing-policy-requirements/), furthering scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>What is DMS Policy?</summary>

  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Data Management and Sharing (DMS) policy requires that all NIH-supported research which generates [scientific data](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html#scientific-data) (barring ethical, legal, or technical factors [limiting data sharing](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html#when-to-not-share)) must create a plan and budget for data management and sharing.

  While some funding announcements for some research may specify which repository should be used to comply with DMS policy, mostly the NIH does not specify [where data should be stored.](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/data-management-and-storage.html#data-repositories). The NIH does provide an [interactive table listing NIH supported data repositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/repositories-for-sharing-scientific-data) than can be used and [suggests that researchers use a repository most appropriate for the data generated from their research](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/selecting-a-data-repository).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is data access managed and requests granted?</summary>

  AnVIL utilizes the Data Use and Oversight System [(DUOS)](https://duos.org/) to efficiently expedite data access and management while maintaining security. Researchers can [explore datasets hosted in the AnVIL cloud and request access using DUOS](https://anvilproject.org/news/2024/11/15/duos-announcement). [Data use limitations can be set if necessary with Data Access Committees reviewing access requests](https://duos.org/anvil_dms_policy).
