# The AnVIL Platform Helps You Meet the New NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy Requirements

As biomedical data grow at an exciting pace, the ability to share them in a way that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) has never been more important. Recognizing this need for better data practices, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has released a new policy, [NOT-OD-21-013](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html) that requires researchers generating NIH-funded data to create a strategy and budget for data management and sharing. The AnVIL is uniquely positioned to fulfill this requirement for researchers.
