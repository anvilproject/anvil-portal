# AnVIL Website Update: AnVIL platform helps meet the new NIH Data Management and Sharing policy requirements

As biomedical data grow at an exciting pace, the ability to share them in a way that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) has never been more important. Recognizing this need for better data practices, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has released a new policy (NOT-OD-21-013) that requires researchers generating NIH-funded data to create a strategy and budget for data management and sharing. The AnVIL is uniquely positioned to fulfill this requirement for researchers.
