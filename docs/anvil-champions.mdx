# AnVIL Champions

AnVIL Champions serve as a local resource within their community (institution, consortium, research group, geographic region, etc.) who can help members of their community that are interested in using AnVIL. They provide a bridge between their community and the AnVIL team, benefiting their communities as well as the broader AnVIL ecosystem. AnVIL Champions can receive specialized support and training from the AnVIL team in order to better assist their communities.

## AnVIL Champions support their communities by:

- Helping community members understand the benefits of AnVIL and get started using the platform
- Guiding community members towards resources for learning more and getting help
- Communicating feedback from their community to the AnVIL team, so that AnVIL can better meet the needs of their community
