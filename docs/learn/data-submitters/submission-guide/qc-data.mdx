<Alert icon={false} severity="info">
    After staging data object files and data model tables in the submission workspace, Data Submitters will use workflows included in the submission workspace to ingest the data into the AnVIL (Terra) Data Repository (TDR).       

Note that the data object files will remain in the submission workspace or external GCS and referenced in TDR. 
</Alert>

## Data Ingestion Process Overview

### 5.1. Grant TDR permission to read data (optional)       
You must do this step if your data is stored outside the submission workspace.  If you uploaded your object data files to the submission workspace in Step 4, you can skip to 5.2.                 

### 5.2. Push data to TDR      
You will run a workflow (included) in the submission workspace to perform this step.    

### 5.3. (optional) - Clean up Staging Workspace     
Once you've reviewed the data in TDR, use the **CleanUpStagingWorkspace workflow** to clean up the staging workspace.
