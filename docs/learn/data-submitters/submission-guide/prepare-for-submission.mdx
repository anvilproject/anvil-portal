  <div>
In this step, you will prepare for data ingestion by organizing all required data and metadata in your data model (step 2) in a format compatible with AnVIL.
</div>
</Alert>

### AnVIL accepts two types of data
- **Object files (large, unstructured data files)**
Object files include genomic and other omics data as well as image files. Object files require minimal metadata, some of which is generated by the AnVIL (such as full paths to the files in AnVIL cloud storage).
**Phenotypes and metadata**
Clinical and phenotypic data as well as object file metadata will be submitted in TSV/TXT format (see requirements below).

**Most studies are submitting both.**

### Formatting requirements for submitted data
You will submit all metadata (including phenotypic data) in a spreadsheet-like file (TSV/TXT format). To prepare data for submission, you will
- Make sure all object files conform to AnVILâ€™s naming requirements
- Generate a TSV file for each table in the data model (clinical data, phenotypes, and metadata from Step 2)
