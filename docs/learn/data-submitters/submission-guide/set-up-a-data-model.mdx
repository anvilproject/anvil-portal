<Alert icon={false} severity="info">
  <div>

After your dataset has been approved by the AnVIL Data Ingestion Committee, you will need to set up and submit your data model, specifying what data you have and how data are connected.

The AnVIL Data Model is intended to:
   - Standardize the data submitted to the AnVIL in order to accept a broad range of high-quality data across consortia
   - Maximize data findability and usefulness, and facilitate cross-study analysis

The first goal requires a very flexible data model, and the second requires some constraints on the data model. The guidelines below are intended to help meet those two goals.
  </div>
</Alert>

As you get started, we recommend you review the AnVIL Data Model Data Dictionary [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112123611582571421629&rtpof=true&sd=true) to learn more about the general structure (which we will describe in more detail below). You’ll coordinate with the AnVIL data ingest team to facilitate submission activities.

If your dataset has been accepted by AnVIL and does not easily fit into an existing template, please reach out to the AnVIL Team at [help@lists.anvilproject.org](mailto:help@lists.anvilproject.org).

You’ll end this step with a better understanding of what your data dictionary will include for your data model. Step 3 will instruct you on preparing your data according to your data model for submission to AnVIL.

## 2.1 \- First Steps
### Definitions
**Data Model:** An implementable definition of a data representation. A data model should describe the entities, attributes, and relationships, and how these are represented, including format and content. Successful models facilitate clear communication of the data and cover the majority of the data in a well-specified domain. 

**Data Dictionary:** An unambiguous description of a specific table of data. A data dictionary should define what the fields are, what values they can have, and any constraints. Data dictionaries must allow for data to be validated for conformance. Data dictionaries:
* Must include descriptions for each column for humans to understand the data
* Must include data types and coded terms for computers to understand the data
### Why a Data Model?
There are often inconsistencies when data is shared, including what ontologies used, formatting, and data types. Established data models provide clear and well-specified standards, formatting, terminologies, and ontologies. This allows for easy exchange and use. The purpose of using a data model when submitting to AnVIL is to maximize the usability of the data. Through using a data model, AnVIL aims to have research data that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). 
### Coordinate with the AnVIL Data Ingest Team
To **collaborate with AnVIL** on uploading data, you’ll **notify AnVIL of completed dbGaP registration** in one of two ways.
* Through an already open AnVIL Zendesk ticket
* By contacting AnVIL support at [anvil-data@broadinstitute.org](mailto:anvil-data@brodinstitute.org)

It is useful to coordinate with AnVIL before you start to set up your data model, in case you run into questions or problems.

## 2.2 \- Create Your AnVIL Data Model

A data model explicitly determines the structure of data. It organizes data elements and standardizes how the data elements relate to one another. Data models should describe data with rich metadata that can be registered or indexed. 

We encourage you to read the [README](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112123611582571421629&rtpof=true&sd=true) and [AnVIL Table Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=139218770#gid=139218770) tabs in the AnVIL Data Model data dictionary as you begin creating your AnVIL Data Model.

These tabs include helpful information such as

* The overall purpose of the data dictionary
* Information on the AnVIL Data Model (findability subset)
* Details on how to expand the data model to fit your needs
* Expectations on how to submit your schema

### Data Model Requirements

The linked [Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112123611582571421629&rtpof=true&sd=true) provides context for mapping data to the AnVIL core findability model. It includes information on the tables to be included, which concepts should be included in each table, and suggested coding systems for each. The Data Dictionary is a learning resource to assist users with creating their own AnVIL Data Model for submission.

Please read the descriptions for each table outlined in the [Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112123611582571421629&rtpof=true&sd=true) carefully, and reach out to your AnVIL team contact with questions not addressed in the data dictionary document. These data model requirements help ensure AnVIL datasets are not only useful to the researchers who created them but also enable others to analyze data collectively across studies in the AnVIL Terra platform.

Start by thinking of what data you have and how you have already organized it and how it may fit or need to be reorganized to fit the requirements.

### Core Tables for All Studies

At a high level, there are three core tables (“entities”) in the AnVIL Data Model: **BioSample**, **Donor**, and **File**.

The **BioSample** table is the only required table, although **Donor** and **File** tables are strongly encouraged to improve the usability and findability of the data.

The specifications for each table, including required fields, strongly recommended fields, field names, and field descriptions, are included in the [Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=211809209#gid=211809209).  Brief descriptions of these core tables, with notable requirements, are below.

Note that data models for submitted datasets are not restricted to what is included in the AnVIL Data Model.

* [**BioSample**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=323182902#gid=323182902) **(required):** Contains information about the sample(s) included in the study.  Example data types include Anatomical Site from which the biosample was taken and the cell type.
  * The `biosample_id` (first column) is required.
  * If a File table will not be submitted, the BioSample table must contain a column indicating which samples correspond to which files.
* [**Donor**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=1923143452#gid=1923143452) **(strongly recommended):** Contains demographic and phenotypic information about the donor. Example data types include phenotypic sex, reported ethnicity, and genetic ancestry.
  * The `donor_id` (first column) is required.
* [**File**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=462062238#gid=462062238) **(strongly recommended):** Contains information for files associated with the study. Example data includes DRS ID, filename, and file type.
  * The `file_id` (first column) is required.
  * It is strongly recommended that the table includes a `BioSample.biosample_id` column to link the biosample id between tables.
  * AnVIl will add DRS URIs for object files as part of the ingest process.


### Optional Tables

The AnVIL Data Model Data Dictionary includes other optional tables you can use to contain data about conditions, activity, and your project. Brief descriptions of these optional tables, with notable requirements, are below.

* [**Condition Table:**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=524240363#gid=524240363) Contains information about condition(s) and phenotypes associated with a donor.
  * The `condition_id` (first column) is required.
  * It is strongly recommended that the table includes a `donor_id` column to link the donor id between tables.
* [**Activity Table:**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=1184610893#gid=1184610893) Contains details on different types of activities used to generate or process data. Example data includes sequencing method, reference assembly, and assay type.
  * The `activity_id` (first column) is required.
  * Should include a `file_id` column that references the associated file.
* [**Project Table:**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=672801364#gid=672801364) Contains information about the project the study is a part of. Example data includes funding, and principal investigator. It is strongly recommended that the table includes a title field.
  * The `project_id` (first column) is required.

#### Non-standard Data Models

If your dataset has been accepted by AnVIL and has needs not described here, please refer to the README on “[Expanding the data model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0L5wm5pnpLKYqakYm9tyy-VmP5oJmGR/edit?gid=211809209#gid=211809209&range=B16:C16)”. Additional tables must be associated with one of the core tables: BioSample, Donor, or File. If you need further assistance, please reach out to the AnVIL Team at help@lists.anvilproject.org. You can work directly with the AnVIL Phenotype WG and Data Ingest WG to integrate into one of these existing data models.

## 2.3 \- Generate Your Data Dictionary

All AnVIL studies must submit a **Data Dictionary table** (spreadsheet file) that defines your complete data model. It includes (in separate tabs for each table) 
* Field names
* Field descriptions
* Field types
* Examples
* Enumeration values (where applicable)
* Multi-value delimiter symbols used (where applicable) for each table in the data model

<Alert severity="warning">
