## Learning Objectives

This week we'll explore elements of reproducible research with the AnVILPublish package. We will illustrate how to make a docker container tailored to a particular purpose (in this case, publishing AnVIL packages!). We'll then emphasize the merits of an R package structure for organizing research activities in a manner that emphasizes provenance and reproducibility. The R package structure coupled with git will form the basis of AnVIL workspace creation, allowing us to maintain a single, version-controlled source for Jupyter notebook or RStudio-based AnVIL workspaces.

## Key Resources

- Visit https://anvil.terra.bio to use the AnVIL platform.
- The directory and text-file structure of R packages make them easy to write, maintain, and validate; the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html) vignette that comes with R is the definitive source; an excellent resource is [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) (e-)book.
- Docker containers form a basis for reproducibility in AnVIL; we make use of custom docker containers extending the [terra-jupyter-bioconductor](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-docker) and [anvilproject-rstudio-bioconductor](https://github.com/anvilproject/anvil-docker) images following instructions at [Docker tutorial: Custom cloud environments for Jupyter notebooks](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360037143432) ([terra-docker/README.md](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-docker/blob/master/README.md) is also useful).

## Review

#### Previously...

- The [course schedule](/events/bioconductor-popup-workshops-20210531#other-sessions) contains links and videos of previous sessions

#### Essential Steps

- Login
- Workspaces
- Billing accounts
- (R-based) Jupyter notebooks or RStudio for interactive analysis

#### Cloud Computing Environment

- Runtime and persistent disk
- Workspace DATA and buckets
- AnVIL package for interaction with workspace components

## Workshop Activities

### What's the purpose?

- RStudio provides a rich environment for working in R, but Jupyter notebooks are also relevant, e.g., providing a focused analysis for less-experienced collaborators to walk through.
- We'd like to be able to provide users with documentation that is accessible in either environment.
- The documentation should be consistent across environments.

#### Provenance is important

- Who wrote or contributed to the software?
- What does the software do?
- What license is it available under?
- What version of the software is currently in use?

### Setup

- Log in to [AnVIL](https://anvil.terra.bio) using the email address you used to register for the course and navigate (via the HAMBURGER) to Workspaces.
- Clone the [Bioconductor-Workshop-AnVILPublish](http://Bioconductor-Workshop-AnVILPublish) workspace
  - Unique workspace name
  - Billing project: deeppilots-bioconductor-jun7

#### Start a CUSTOM CLOUD ENVIRONMENT

- 'Cloud Environment' in the top right of the workspace, choose 'Customize'
  ![Customize Cloud Environment](/consortia/learn/data-analysts/anvilpublish-customize-cloud-environment.png)
- From the 'Application Configuration' dropdown, choose 'Custom Environment'
  ![Select Custom Environment](/consortia/learn/data-analysts/anvilpublish-selected-custom-environment.png)
- For 'Container Image' enter gcr.io/bioconductor-anvil/anvil-rstudio-bioconductor-anvilpublish:3.12-0.0.2
  ![Enter Container Image](/consortia/learn/data-analysts/anvilpublish-container-image.png)

## R Packages

Create local git clones of the source code of two packages

```shell
system2("git", c("clone", "https://github.com/Bioconductor/AnVILPublish"))
system2("git", c("clone", "https://github.com/mtmorgan/AnVILPublishDemo"))
```

Simple text-based files organize R code, help pages, vignettes, and metadata.

```
AnVILPublishDemo$ tree
.
├── DESCRIPTION
├── NAMESPACE
├── R
│   └── utilities.R
├── README.md
├── man
│   └── utilities.Rd
└── vignettes
└── A_Introduction.Rmd
```

Packages are extensible, e.g., all files under an 'inst/' directory are installed with the package

```
├── inst
│   ├── docker
│   │   ├── anvil-rstudio-bioconductor-anvilpublish
│   │   │   └── Dockerfile
│   │   └── terra-juptyer-bioconductor-anvilpublish
│   │       └── Dockerfile
│   ├── tables
│   │   └── participants.csv
│   └── workflows
│       └── coming_soon.wdl
```

The DESCRIPTION file provides provenance, including title, version, description, author(s) & their contributions, licensing, as well as system dependencies.

```
Package: AnVILPublishDemo
Title: Simple Demonstration of AnVILPublish Functionality

))
Description: AnVILPublish is a way to transform R / Bioconductor
packages, especially vignettes, in Jupyter notebooks for use in
the AnVIL computational environment. The AnVILPublishDemo package
illustrates some of this functionality.

RoxygenNote: 7.1.1

```

#### Vignettes

- A natural place to document what the package does in a narrative 'literate programming' manner. If the code in the vignette does not work, then the package does not build and check successfully.
- Vignettes may also contain metadata, e.g., the author and date last revised.

### From R Package to AnVIL Workspace

Easy!

```shell
AnVILPublish::as_workspace(
"~/AnVILPublishDemo",
"deeppilots-bioconductor-jun7",
"AnVILPublishDemo-YOUR_NAME_HERE",
create = TRUE
)
```

What do we get?

- DASHBOARD: Provenance -- title, authors, description, version, license
- NOTEBOOKS: ready to evaluate under an R kernel
- DATA: tables from packages added. Interpolation of google bucket possible
- All described in the AnVILPublish vignette

Maybe a little surprising...

- The package can be developed on your own computer (for instance), and published from there, provided gcloud software is installed.

### A Little Under the Hood: Custom Docker Files

## Summary

### What You've Accomplished

Appreciated R package structure

- Organizing components of analysis
- Literate programming
- Provenance

Transforming packages to notebooks and workspaces

- Metadata as DASHBOARD entries, including provenance
- Vignettes as Jupyter notebooks
- DATA tables populated from the package
- Coming soon: addition of workflows; creating workspaces for RStudio

## Next Steps

- Follow instructions at [Set up billing with $300 Google credits to explore Terra](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360046295092) to enable billing for your own projects.

## Frequently Asked Question

- What docker images can be used as base images for customization? The main images derive from [terra-jupyter-bioconductor](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-docker/tree/master/terra-jupyter-bioconductor) (for Jupyter-based images) and [anvil-rstudio-bioconductor](https://github.com/anvilproject/anvil-docker/tree/master/anvil-rstudio-bioconductor) (for RStudio-based images). Any container can be used in a workflow.
- Can you specify the runtime environment as part of the workspace? This does not seem to be possible at the moment. One could include a notebook or other code that checked the runtime to see that it meets particular conditions, but this would rely on the user running the code.
- Enhance reproducibility by 'fixing' package versions, e.g., using packr? Instead, specify precise package versions in a customized Dockerfile.
