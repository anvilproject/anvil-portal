To use AnVIL, you will need a Google account to authenticate with Terra and the AnVil Data Explorer and to associate your Terra account with a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.

If you are accessing controlled-access data, you will also need an eRA commons id or to be a member of a data-sharing consortium.

To enable dbGaP data use authorizations to flow through from dbGaP to Terra, you must link your Terra account with your eRA Commons ID.

The guides below walk you through each step in the account setup process.

## Account Setup Checklist

1. [Set up a Terra account](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360028235911-How-to-register-for-a-Terra-account) - To register for a [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces) account, you will need a Gmail account or another email account (an institutional email, for example) associated with a Google identity.

1. [Set up Terra account with non-Google email](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029186611-Setting-up-a-Google-account-with-a-non-Google-email) - If your email is not associated with a Google identity, follow these steps to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address.

1. [Link your Terra and eRA Commons ID](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360038086332-Linking-Terra-to-External-Servers) - To use controlled-access data on Terra, you will need to link your Terra user ID to your authorization account (such as a dbGaP account). Linking to external servers will allow Terra to automatically determine if you can access controlled datasets hosted in Terra (ex., TCGA, TOPMed, etc.) based on your approved dbGaP applications.

Next, see [Requesting Data Access](/learn/find-data/requesting-data-access) for more information about accessing controlled access data and configuring Terra to read your data access privileges from dbGaP or your consortia access control list.
