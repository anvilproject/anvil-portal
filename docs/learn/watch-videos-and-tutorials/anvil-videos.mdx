## AnVIL Shorts

Check out our nine AnVIL Shorts, or 2-minute videos about AnVIL and how it can support your lab and research. These videos demonstrate how AnVIL supports important research principles including reproducibility, scalability, sharing, and standardization. The Shorts also introduce AnVIL for various researcher "persona" perspectives, highlighting the aspects of the platform that are most relevant for Data Analysts, Data Submitters, PIs, and Instructors.
