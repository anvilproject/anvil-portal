                <Description><![CDATA[
<p>The genetic basis of coronary artery disease in individuals of non-European ancestry is largely unknown. The Washington University Coronary Artery Disease Study (WUCADS) recruited participants of non-European ancestry with and without coronary artery disease to address this question. Whole genome sequencing in WUCADS was performed at the McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University. </p>]]>

                <StudyInEx><![CDATA[
<p><b>Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:</b><br/> We recruited WUCADS participants from the BJC HealthCare network. Subjects were eligible to participate as a case if they were of self-identified non-European ancestry and had a history of significant coronary artery disease defined as myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stenosis &#8805; 50% in a major epicardial coronary artery. To enrich cases for those most likely to be influenced by genetic factors, we preferentially focused on individuals who were diagnosed with significant coronary artery disease at or before the age of 60 and 70 for men and women, respectively. Subjects were eligible to participate as a control if they were of self-identified non-European ancestry and did not have a history of significant coronary artery disease defined above.</p>]]>
