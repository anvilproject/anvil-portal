<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) has funded the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG), a collaborative large-scale genome sequencing effort to comprehensively identify rare risk and protective variants contributing to common disease phenotypes and to better understand the general principles of genomic architecture underlying common, complex inherited diseases.</p> <p>This study contains variant calls derived from the whole genome sequence data of an early-onset coronary artery disease case-control cohort selected from Emory University Cardiovascular Biobank. Case status was assigned based on the presence of myocardial infarction, coronary artery stenosis greater than 70% in at least one coronary artery, and/or revascularization (coronary angioplasty with or without stent placement or coronary artery bypass grafting) at an early age. For these samples &#34;early age&#34; is defined as men 60 years of age or younger and women 70 years of age or younger.
