# Using AnVIL

## What analysis tools can I use for data analysis on AnVIL?

- <Link label="WDL" url="https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/" /> - Batch processing
  of GATK and other workflows
- <Link label="Jupyter" url="https://jupyter.org/" /> - Interactive analysis with
  the python or R programming languages; the R environment includes a family of <Link
    label="Bioconductor"
    url="https://www.bioconductor.org/"
  /> 3.10 packages
- <Link label="R Studio" url="https://rstudio.com/" /> - Interactive analysis with
  your favorite R coding platform
- <Link label="Galaxy" url="https://galaxyproject.org/" /> - Access thousands of
  tools via an intuitive graphical user interface for processing batch analysis with
  Galaxy Workflows and interactive downstream visualizations.
- <Link

## What data are available on AnVIL?

AnVIL provides access to a diverse array of genomic data sets that can be accessed
here (<Link label="https://anvil.terra.bio/#library/datasets" url="https://anvil.terra.bio/#library/datasets" />). These data include both unrestricted access and restricted access
datasets. Data access requests are submitted according to the guidelines provided by the data provider or consortium.

NHGRI consortium data will be hosted primarily on AnVIL. Initial releases of data from the Centers For Common Disease
Genomics (CCDG), Centers for Mendelian Diseases (CMG), Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, and
Clinical Sequencing Evidence-generating Research (CSER) consortium will be hosted on AnVIL. Researchers can apply for
access to these data on dbGaP (<Link label="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" url="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" />). Once granted access, users can access their data on
the Terra component of AnVIL by linking their eRA identities. Data will be made available to users in shared Workspaces
and later accessible from Gen3.

## Which of the NHGRI consortium data are available on AnVIL?

Initial releases and project IDs of datasets from the CCDG, CMG, eMERGE, CSER, and GTEx can be found on
the <Link label="AnVIL Data Dashboard" url="https://anvilproject.org/data/consortia" />.

## Where can I find documentation to “get started” on AnVIL?

There are <Link label="resources" url={`${portalURL}/learn`}/> available on the AnVIL Portal to help users get registered on AnVIL and provide some
introductory usage guides.

## Can NIH Intramural Investigators use AnVIL?

Yes. AnVIL is a community resource that is available to both NIH extramural and intramural researchers. Interested
intramural investigators should contact AnVIL Program Staff (<Link label="anvil@mail.nih.gov" url="mailto:anvil@mail.nih.gov" />) to discuss whether AnVIL can serve
their lab’s data sharing needs. If so, NIH Intramural investigators and their lab members may deposit data in the AnVIL
for sharing with the scientific community and may request access to data stored in AnVIL following the procedures
described in these FAQs.
Intramural investigators will have access to AnVIL workspaces in a secure cloud-based environment. They will be subject
to the same storage, compute, and egress charges as extramural investigators, and must set up a Google Cloud billing
account to get started (see <Link label="here" url={`${portalURL}/learn`} /> for more information). Intramural investigators may wish to contact
the <Link label="NIH STRIDES Initiative" url="https://datascience.nih.gov/strides" /> to explore discounts on Google cloud services, in
addition to other training and professional services.
