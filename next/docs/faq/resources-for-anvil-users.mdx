# Resources for AnVIL Users

## Which NHGRI datasets does AnVIL host?

The current list of large-scale datasets which will be available through AnVIL are:

- GSP, including CMGs and CCDGs
- GTEx
- 1000 Genomes
- eMERGE
- CSER (coming soon)

The AnVIL Data Dashboard provides a real time view of which data sets and individual projects are available
on [AnVIL]({portalURL}/data/consortia).

## What user training will AnVIL provide?

AnVIL will offer training materials, online Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) modules as well as periodic workshops to
engage with the AnVIL user community.

## How does AnVIL handle users’ cloud service costs?

The AnVIL utilizes the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Cloud storage, data egress and computing services of the AnVIL are
provided under a ‘user-pays, pass-through’ model. Users of the AnVIL pay for the services they consume on the GCP at the
rate charged by the cloud vendor ([https://cloud.google.com/pricing](https://cloud.google.com/pricing)) with no additional charges or licensing fees.
Users do not pay storage fees for data hosted by AnVIL, but any derivative data created by the user will incur storage
fees.

A new Terra user is eligible for
the [free credits program](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360046295092-Set-up-billing-with-300-Google-credits-to-explore-Terra).
The program begins once you accept the Terms and Conditions, and will expire either after 60 days or after you have used
$300 worth of credits, whichever happens first. NHGRI is also planning to provide AnVIL users with credits for cloud
service charges at the discounted rate negotiated by the [NIH STRIDES](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) initiative
with GCP.
