<EventsHero {...frontmatter} />

Bioconductor popup workshops provide short (less than 1 hour) virtual sessions to highlight specific parts of the Terra / [AnVIL][1] ecosystem for R and [Bioconductor][2] users.

The sessions are easy for participants to join and follow along, with minimal prerequisite skills or knowledge; it is not necessary to attend all workshops.

Sessions will have short presentations, with abundant opportunity for questions and ‘round table’ discussion about the topic of the workshop or other AnVIL-related activities.

The main goal is to engage and enable the use of AnVIL / Terra by R users. All sessions will be recorded and available after the workshop. Each workshop will include a short one-page summary of key learning objectives.

## Tutorials and Videos

For a tutorial based on the workshop with an accompanying tutorial see [Running a Workflow: Bulk RNASeq Differential Expression from FASTQ Files to Top Table](/learn/data-analysts/running-a-workflow).

## To Register

## Schedule

All workshops are offered on Mondays at lunchtime, 12:00 - 1:00 US Eastern, starting April 26.
