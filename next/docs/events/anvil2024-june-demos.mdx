## What are AnVIL Demos?

AnVIL Demos are a series of virtual meetings that highlight what you can do on the [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL), a cloud-based computing platform for genomic data science. AnVIL Demos will start out with a 30-minute demonstration on the platform followed by open time for Q&A and user support.

In the demos, presenters will highlight anything from a capability of the platform to a scientific analysis powered by AnVIL. If you’re interested in showcasing how you use AnVIL at a future AnVIL Demos session, reach out to [Natalie Kucher]({natalieKucher}).

After the demo, we’ll open up the floor to answer questions about the demo and to answer any other questions you might have about AnVIL.

### 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM ET – Demo on AnVIL

In this demo, Jason Walker from Washington University in Saint Louis presented on the NHGRI consortium Centers for Common Disease Genomics Quality Control (QC) Analysis Pipeline for WGS data available to run in AnVIL. You can find the documentation for the pipeline in the [QC Analysis Pipeline GitHub repository](https://github.com/genome/qc-analysis-pipeline).

### 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM ET – Q&A

Participants will have an opportunity to ask questions about the demonstration and we will have AnVIL and Terra Support on the line to answer questions about AnVIL beyond the demo.
