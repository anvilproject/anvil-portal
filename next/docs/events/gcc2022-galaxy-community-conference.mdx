## Description

The 2022 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2022) brings together hundreds of researchers, trainers, tool developers, software engineers, and computational infrastructure providers, all addressing common challenges in data intensive science using the Galaxy data integration and analysis platform.

This annual gathering of the Galaxy community includes training, talks, posters, demos, Birds of a Feather meetups, and many other opportunities for collaboration and networking. There is no better event to share your work and learn form others working in data-intensive science.
