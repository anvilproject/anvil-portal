## Description

The 2023 meeting will address DNA sequence variation and its role in molecular evolution, population genetics and complex diseases, comparative genomics, large-scale studies of gene and protein expression, and genomic approaches to ecological systems. Both technologies and applications will be emphasized. In addition, there will be a special session on the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research.

The [James P. Taylor Foundation for Open Science](https://jxtxfoundation.org/) will award six scholarships covering full conference registration to outstanding graduate students. Application deadline is February 6, 2023. For details and application instructions, visit [here](https://jxtxfoundation.org/news/2022-12-16-bg/).
