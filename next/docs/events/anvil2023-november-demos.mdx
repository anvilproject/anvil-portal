## What are AnVIL Demos?

AnVIL Demos are a series of virtual meetings that highlight what you can do on the [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL), a cloud-based computing platform for genomic data science. AnVIL Demos will start out with a 30-minute demonstration on the platform followed by open time for Q&A and user support.

In the demos, presenters will highlight anything from a capability of the platform to a scientific analysis powered by AnVIL. If you’re interested in showcasing how you use AnVIL at a future AnVIL Demos session, reach out to [Natalie Kucher](mailto:nkucher3@jhu.edu).

After the demo, we’ll open up the floor to answer questions about the demo and to answer any other questions you might have about AnVIL.

## What’s in this Demo?

#### 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM ET – Demo on AnVIL

In this demo, Vincent Carey from Harvard Medical School will share how to use Bioconductor for Machine Learning.

#### 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM ET – Q&A

Participants will have an opportunity to ask questions about the demonstration and we will have AnVIL and Terra Support on the line to answer questions about AnVIL beyond the demo.
