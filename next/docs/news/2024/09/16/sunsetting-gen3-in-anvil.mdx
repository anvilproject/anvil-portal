Dear AnVIL Users,

We want to make you aware that starting **October 1, 2024**, the AnVIL Gen3 Commons and free downloadable version of GTEx v8 through Gen3 will be decommissioned. The [AnVIL Data Explorer]({browserURL}/beta-announcement), which has been beta launched and now hosts over 250 AnVIL datasets, will be the recommended method for accessing GTEx data through AnVIL.

More details about the anticipated scope of impact are described below.

## Scope of impact

- Users will no longer be able to [download GTEx v8](/learn/reference/gtex-v8-free-egress-instructions) for free, and downloads will be subject to Google Cloud Platform egress fees. However, GTEx v8 will still be available for analysis on AnVIL on Terra with access via either the [AnVIL Data Explorer]({browserURL}/datasets) or [AnVIL Dataset Catalog]({portalURL}/data/consortia/GTEx/workspaces).
    - See the help articles linked here for more information on how to access data through the [Explorer]({browserURL}/guides) or [Terra](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/4402326091675-Accessing-GTEx-TARGET-TCGA-data).
- Data export as PFBs from https://gen3.theanvil.io to Cavatica and Terra will no longer be available.
- Access to data via DRS from https://gen3.theanvil.io will stop.
- Existing DRS URIs minted by AnVIL Gen3 will be resolvable and accessible in Terra and by external systems when AnVIL RAS is available.

If you believe that this change will impact your work, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to [anvil-data@broadinstitute.org](mailto:anvil-data@broadinstitute.org) or the [AnVIL Support Forum]({anvilHelpURL}). We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Thank you,

The AnVIL Team
