<NewsHero {...frontmatter}># Dockstore: An Introduction</NewsHero>

Dockstore is a platform for sharing portable, container-based tools and workflows written in CWL, WDL, and Nextflow.

This webinar covers the basics of Dockstore, how it is useful for the community, and how to use it in your research. It also covers the fundamentals of finding workflows on the registry and provide examples of running them on sample data.

This is the first in a series of regular tutorials we have planned for 2020. Future sessions will focus on how to package tools with Docker, how to write portable workflows using CWL, WDL, and/or Nextflow, and how to use developer features of Dockstore to streamline workflow and tool sharing.
