# Creating Events

The AnVIL portal lists events:

1. In the events section available from the top nav,
1. Optionally in the featured events section on the home page,
1. In site search results,
1. and also in external search results and when an event item is shared on social media.

## Markdown Files

Events are implemented with markdown files under the `/content/events` directory in the AnVIL Portal GitHub repository.

## URLS and File Names

Events use the conference name as a prefix for the URL giving URLs like:

`https://anvilproject.org/events/bcc2020-dockstore-fundamentals`

In the URL above, `bcc2020` is the conference name and `dockstore-fundamentals` is a shortened version of the event name.

The URL for the event is determined by the event file name. For the URL above the corresponding markdown file is:

`bcc2020-dockstore-fundamentals.md`

When preparing to list an event on the AnVIL portal please collect / provide the following information in either a Google doc or pull request.

## Front Matter

The front matter information controls how the event displays in lists, if it appears on the home page, and how the event appears when sharing on social media. Front matter fields for events are:

| Field        | Example                                                                                                                                                                                  |

_An introduction to the AnVIL platform to enable CCDG and CMG researchers
to analyze GSP data using AnVIL tools. Participants will gain exposure and familiarity
with available data, tools, workflows, training materials, and support channels of AnVIL.
Participants will not become bioinformatic experts, but will know what to do
or who to contact when the time comes._

### Background

A longer form background/rational for why this session is being provided. For example:

_In summer 2020, NHGRI plans to organize Massive Genome Informatics in the

AnVIL platform for cloud-based genomics data analysis._

### Audience

A description of the target audience / qualifications for attending. Similar to: _No computational expertise is required.
Anyone from GSP who would like to learn about cloud based genomic analysis on AnVIL.
This Jamboree will focus on highlighting interactive tools that are used from a
graphical user interface._

### Prerequisites if Any
