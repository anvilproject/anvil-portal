The Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium is a national multi-site research program funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD).

Prioritizing engagement of traditionally underrepresented populations in genomics research, CSER’s seven clinical sites seek to study the effectiveness of integrating genome sequencing into the clinical care of diverse and medically underserved individuals. CSER’s research goals include measuring sequencing’s clinical utility through patient and familial responses to genomic testing and evaluating patient-provider-laboratory interactions that influence the use of sequencing. Drawing from the expertise of clinicians, scientists, ethicists, bioinformaticians, economists, and legal scholars, CSER is poised to develop and share best practices in areas such as the discovery and interpretation of genomic variants, return of results, healthcare utilization, health outcomes and metrics, and the ethical, legal, and social implications of sequencing in diverse populations.

## CSER diversity & inclusion statement

In CSER, we aim to improve the use of genetic information in medicine and reduce barriers to genetic services among underserved groups. Our research seeks to better understand connections between genes, other drivers of health and disease, and health outcomes. We have worked with study participants and community partners to help make our research more inclusive. We still have much more work to do to ensure that our findings are applied in fair and just ways. We also acknowledge the need for more diversity among our own researchers. As we publish the results of CSER, we commit to carrying efforts forward to make sure people of all backgrounds benefit from genomic research and medicine.
