<Subheader>26 October, 2020</Subheader>

A multitude of posters highlighting CSER research will be featured at the <Link label="American Society of Human Genetics 2020 Annual Meeting" url="https://www.ashg.org/meetings/2020meeting/"/>. ASHG 2020 is being held **virtually**, and will run from October 27 to 30.

### October 28, 2020

**Presentation (11:15am - 11:30am ET)**\
**Full Scientific Session (10:30am - 12:00pm ET)**

- **Julianne O'Daniel** (NCGENES 2) will be giving a presentation (<Link label="#1159" url="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9070/presentation/1479"/>) as part of a session (<Link label="#018" url="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9070/session/491"/>) on Strength in Diversity highlighting an effort to understand how universities and research institutions can build trust in African American communities. The team presented an interactive panel discussion at a Black Communities Conference for Collaboration in Durham, NC. The session was recorded and audience members were asked to fill in a short survey. These responses were analyzed and the team noted that although mistrust was pervasive in this highly educated group, it was not a barrier to participate in past or future genomic medicine studies. However, there continues to be a need to build trust in underrepresented communities.
