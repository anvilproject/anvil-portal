# Out Now! CSER & eMERGE Variant Bakeoff 2.0

<Subheader>26 October, 2020</Subheader>

A collaborative project between the Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium and Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network will be published in the November 2020 issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics. This paper, led by Laura Amendola from the Kaiser Permanente CHARM project and Dr. Gail Jarvik the PI of the CSER coordinating center, describes how the nine laboratories that perform genome or exome sequencing for these inititives explored current sources of discordance in germline variant classification. The authors found that concordance rates have increased in the last five years, and were highest for variants with uncertain clinical significance. Considerations for variants classified as likely pathogenic, ongoing sources of discordance and suggestions to further increase agreement are presented.
