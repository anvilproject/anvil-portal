# CSER at ASHG 2017

<Subheader>16 October, 2017</Subheader>

**CSER consortium research, including oral platform presentations, posters, and scientific session presentations, will be featured at the <Link label="American Society of Human Genetics 2017 Annual Meeting" url="http://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/"/>**. This annual meeting is a forum for sharing and discussing the latest research in human genetics, and features topics such as returning sequencing results to patients, diversity in genomics research, cancer genetics, gene expression, and more. The ASHG 2017 annual meeting will run from October 17 - 21 2017, in Orlando, Florida.

To aid all ASHG 2017 attendees, numerous resources are available, such as an <Link label="online planner" url="https://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/pages/online-planner.shtml"/> and <Link label="events schedule" url="http://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/asp/soe/webroot/soe.shtml"/>. The CSER Twitter account will also be tweeting about ASHG 2017, so feel free to mention <Link label="@hail_CSER" url="https://twitter.com/hail_cser"/> to connect.

. Below is a sampling of CSER projects that will be showcased at ASHG 2017:

### October 18, 2017

**Posters, Exhibit Hall 1 @ Orange County Convention Center, <NBS>2:00pm - 4:00pm</NBS>**

- **Kyle Brothers** (CSER site: HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology) is presenting a poster
  summarizing results from the HudsonAlpha CSER1 study, concluding that parents of children with intellectual
  disability may receive greater utility from genomic sequencing if it is performed earlier in a child's
  life (poster abstract #529/W).
- **Laura Amendola** (CSER1 site: University of Washington) is presenting a poster highlighting
  common reasons for patients to decline participation in CSER1 research (poster abstract #550/W).

### October 19, 2017

**Presentation, Room 230C @ Orange County Convention Center, <NBS>9:45am - 10:00am</NBS>**

- **Michelle Thompson** (CSER site: HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology) is <Link label="presenting research on HudsonAlpha's experiences with identifying secondary findings" url="https://ep70.eventpilotadmin.com/web/page.php?page=IntHtml&amp;project=ASHG17&amp;id=170120987"/>.

**Posters, Exhibit Hall 1 @ Orange County Convention Center, <NBS>2:00pm - 4:00pm</NBS>**

- **Natasha Strande** (CSER site: University of North Carolina) is presenting a poster detailing experiences from the CSER1 NCGenes study in returning secondary findings beyond the ACMG recommendations, highlighting lessons learned during the entire process, from returning secondary findings to follow-up (poster abstract #2561/T).
- **Katrina Goddard** (CSER site: Kaiser Permanente Northwest) is presenting a poster summarizing results from the CSER1 NextGen study that conducted expanded carrier screening in preconception families, highlighting experiences and implications for future research (poster abstract #536/T).

### October 20, 2017

**Invited Presentation: <Link label="Clinical Spotlight: Translational Genomics: Psychological and Health Behavior Research Outcomes" url="http://www.ashg.org/2017meeting/listing/NumberedSessions.shtml#sess77"/>, Room 220B @ Orange County Convention Center, <NBS>2:30pm - 4:30pm</NBS>**

- **Barbara Biesecker** (CSER site: ClinSeq), **Stacy Gray** (CSER1 site: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), and **David Veenstra** (CSER1 site: University of Washington) will be presenting on various experiences in CSER1, such as the psychological and healthcare resource utlization outcomes of genomic sequencing, in an invited presentation session.
