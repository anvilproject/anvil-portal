# CSER1 Experiences with Secondary Findings

<Subheader>05 October, 2018</Subheader>

Available online now, the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) consortium undertook an analysis of prevalence, patient perspectives, family history assessment, and near-term induced healthcare costs upon disclosure of actionable secondary findings (SFs) from the ACMG 56 gene-condition list. This work demonstrates SFs impact previously unrecognized family history, reveal little distress on patients, and induce modest 1-year downstream medical costs. Building from this evidence, future evaluations are necessary to understand additional economic and patient impacts, since, other trade-offs are critical to appraise with increased access to clinical genomic sequencing.
