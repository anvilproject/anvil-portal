# CSER Marker Paper

<Subheader>06 September, 2018</Subheader>

A Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium paper describing the new program has been accepted for publication in the September issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics. The manuscript includes authors across all CSER sites, and was led by University of Washington Coordinating Center (UW CC) and Kaiser Permanente Northwest project member Laura Amendola under the guidance of senior authors Baylor College of Medicine project PI Sharon Plon and UW CC PI Gail Jarvik. The paper includes background on practical and ethical considerations addressed thus far in clinical genomics implementation, and highlights how the work of the CSER consortium aims to address persistent evidence gaps with a focus on delivering genomics in non-academic settings, including stakeholder input, engaging non-English speaking participants and exploring participant perceptions of personal utility. The high level organization of the consortium and clinical projects are described, as well as early efforts to harmonize outcomes by CSER working groups.
