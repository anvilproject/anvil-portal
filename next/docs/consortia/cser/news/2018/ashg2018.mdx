# CSER at ASHG 2018

<Subheader>15 October, 2018</Subheader>

**CSER consortium research, including oral platform presentations, posters, and scientific session presentations, will be featured at the American Society of Human Genetics 2018 Annual Meeting**. This annual meeting serves as a platform for presenting, sharing, and discussing cutting-edge science in every area of human genetics. The ASHG 2018 annual meeting will run from October 16 - 20, 2018, in San Diego, California.

To aid all ASHG 2018 attendees, numerous resources are available, such as an events schedule.

. Below is a sampling of CSER efforts that will be showcased at ASHG 2018:

### October 17, 2018

**Presentation, Room 6C @ San Diego Conference Center, <NBS>11:30am - 12:00pm</NBS>**

In a concurrent session titled "Achieving Genomics Literacy for the Masses: Providing Meaningful Education for Multiple Audiences" (scientific session 15), **Kelly East** (CSER2 project: SouthSeq) will present on experiences with genomic medicine in the clinic and utilizing the CSER1 Guide to Interpreting Genomic Reports toolkit, a resource for non-genetics healthcare practitioners.

**Posters, Exhibit Hall, Ground Level @ San Diego Conference Center, <NBS>3:00pm - 4:00pm</NBS>**

- **Kevin Bowling** (CSER2 project: SouthSeq) will summarize genome sequencing efforts for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) newborns at hospitals in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, with a focus on the SouthSeq project (Abstract 3000/W).
- **Shannon Rego** (CSER2 project: P3EGS) will highlight the value of whole exome sequencing in medically underserved and underrepresented populations by presenting three cases where WES, which would have not been conducted due healthcare barriers like cost and lack of insurance coverage, was the critical reason for a diagnosis (Abstract 1314/W).

### October 18, 2018

**Posters, Exhibit Hall, Ground Level @ San Diego Conference Center, <NBS>2:00pm - 3:00pm</NBS>**

- **Laura Amendola** (CSER2 project: CHARM) will present on the CSER CHARM study's approach of adapting genetic counselling approaches to lower health literacy patients from medically underserved and ancestrally diverse backgrounds, primarily by reducing the literacy level needed to understand communication (Abstract 601/T).
- **Ragan Hart** (CSER1 project: MedGen) will highlight the value of using real-world pharmacogenomics knowledge resources to guide clinical decision-making (Abstract 607/T).

### October 19, 2018

**Posters, Exhibit Hall, Ground Level @ San Diego Conference Center, <NBS>3:00pm - 4:00pm</NBS>**

- **Beatriz Anguiano** (CSER2 project: P3EGS) will reflect on early lessons from recruiting non-English speaking families for the P3EGS CSER study. Challenges faced thus far include healthcare interpreters' lack of knowledge with genetic terminology, more time needed for interpreted conversations with families, and increased likelihood of misapprehension in complex areas such as insurance coverage, genetic discrimination, uncertainty, and secondary findings (Abstract 620/F).
