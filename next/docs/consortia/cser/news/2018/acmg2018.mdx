# CSER at ACMG 2018

<Subheader>04 April, 2018</Subheader>

**CSER consortium research, including oral platform presentations, posters, and scientific session presentations, will be featured at the <Link label="American College of Medical Genetics 2018 Annual Meeting" url="http://www.acmgmeeting.net/acmg2018/Public/mainhall.aspx"/>**. This annual meeting is an educational and networking event for the rapidly advancing field of medical genomics and its integration into healthcare, and will feature topics on both the current and future practice of genomics in healthcare. The ACMG 2018 annual meeting will run from April 10 to 14, 2018, in Charlotte, North Carolina.

To aid all ACMG 2018 attendees, numerous resources are available, such as an <Link label="events schedule" url="https://acmg.expoplanner.com/index.cfm?do=expomap.sessResults&amp;search_type=all&amp;event_id=12"/>. The CSER Twitter account will also be tweeting about ACMG 2018, so feel free to mention <Link label="@hail_CSER" url="https://twitter.com/hail_cser?lang=en" /> to connect.

### April 12, 2018

**Posters, Exhibit Halls BC @ Charlotte Convention Center, <NBS>10:00am - 11:30am</NBS>**

- A multitude of CSER Phase 1 (CSER1) and CSER Phase 2 (CSER2) posters will be presented. **Ellen Howerton** (NHGRI) will present a poster summarizing achievements from CSER1 (abstract #247), **Jonathan Berg** (CSER2 project: NCGenes2) will present a poster introducing CSER2 (abstract #573) and **Lucia Hindorff** (NHGRI) will present results from a CSER1-wide project analyzing the prevalence, costs, and patient perspectives of returning secondary findings (abstract #219).
- **Kalotina Machini** (CSER1 project: MedSeq) will summarize results and experiences from the completed CSER1 MedSeq project. Some highlights include reflection on the initial analysis and reanalysis of 100 MedSeq genomes (50 healthy individuals and 50 with a cardiomyopathy diagnosis), and the associated challenges and lessons learned (abstract #653).
- **Jacqueline Odgis** (CSER2 project: NYCKidSeq) will introduce the CSER2 NYCKidSeq project out of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai CSER grant (poster #381). More information about <Link label="NYCKidSeq can be found on their website" url="https://nyckidseq.org/"/>.

### April 13, 2018

**Posters, Exhibit Halls BC @ Charlotte Convention Center, <NBS>10:30am - 12:00pm</NBS>**

- **Malia Fullerton** (CSER1 project: NextMedicine) will present results from a set of interviews with participants investigating family communication practices in response to receiving negative, uncertain, or positive genomic findings (abstract #590).

### April 14, 2018

**Scientific Concurrent Session: <Link label="Genomic-Based Population Screening of Adults: If? When? How?" url="https://acmg.expoplanner.com/index.cfm?do=expomap.sess&amp;event_id=12&amp;session_id=6343"/>, Richardson Ballroom BC, <NBS>8:00am - 10:00am</NBS>**

- Two CSER1 investigators, **James Evans** (CSER1 project: NCGenes1) and **David Veenstra** (CSER1 project: NextMedicine) will be presenting thoughts and experiences on what is known and what needs to be known before genomic screening of entire populations can begin.
