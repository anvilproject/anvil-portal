CSER consortium research, spanning both posters and presentations, will be featured at the American College of
Medical Genetics 2019 Annual Meeting. This annual meeting serves as a platform to share and discuss the cutting
edge of genetics and genomics, as well as providing opportunities for learning, networking, and more. ACMG 2019 will
run from April 2 - 6, 2019, in Seattle, WA.

### April 02, 2019

**Workshop - Addressing Literacy and Language to Equitably Deliver on the Promise of Precision Medicine, Room 606 - 609 @ Washington State Convention Center, <NBS>11:30am - 12:00pm</NBS>**

Join CSER investigators **Laura Amendola** (CHARM), **Carol Horowitz** (NYCKidSeq PI), **Nangel Lindberg** (CHARM), **Sharon Plon** (KidsCanSeq PI), and **Christine Rini** (NCGENES 2 PI) in a workshop session reflecting on CSER experiences in engaging underserved and underrepresented populations in genomic research studies. Key challenges faced include navigating complexities in developing materials, translating documents into Spanish, and adjusting language for a lower literacy population.

### April 04, 2019

**Poster Session, Exhibit Hall 4ABCD @ Washington State Convention Center, <NBS>10:30am - 12:00pm</NBS>**

- Numerous CSER investigators will be prsenting on early and preliminary observations of their CSER projects, including **Kevin Bowling** (SouthSeq, Abstract #683) and **Anne Slavotinek** (P3EGS, Abstract #301).
- **Alice Popejoy** (ClinGen) will highlight a joint CSER-ClinGen effort to develop a survey to query clinical genomics professionals with the goal of eliciting current perspectives and practices on the use of race, ethnicity, and ancestry information in clinical genomics and patient care (Abstract #319).
- **Julianne O'Daniel** (NCGENES 2) will discuss the NCGENES 2 project's efforts in engaging patient & community stakeholders in developing their NCGENES 2 study, highlighting the value of stakeholder engagement in the project (Abstract #847).

### April 05, 2019

**Poster Session, Exhibit Hall 4ABCD @ Washington State Convention Center, <NBS>10:30am - 12:00pm</NBS>**

- Highlights from CSER's preliminary efforts continue today, with posters from **Jackie Odgis** (NYCKidSeq, Abstract #1004) and **Melissa Wasserstein** (NYCKidSeq, Abstract #996).
- **Tia Kauffman** (CHARM, Abstract #990) will discuss the project's successes using an online approach to identify and consent participants for their project.
