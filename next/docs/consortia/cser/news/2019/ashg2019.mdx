# CSER at ASHG 2019

<Subheader>14 October, 2019</Subheader>

A multitude of posters highlighting CSER research will be featured at the American Society of Human Genetics 2019 Annual Meeting. ASHG 2019 runs from October 15 to 19 in Houston, Texas.

A <Link label="full list of CSER work at ASHG 2019 can be found online here" url="https://cser-consortium.org/system/files/attachments/cser_ashg_2019_posters_and_presentations_2019-10-09.pdf" />. Below is a sampling of CSER efforts that will be showcased at ASHG 2019:


### October 16, 2019

**Poster Session, Exhibit Hall Level 1 @ George R. Brown Convention Center, <NBS>3:00pm - 4:00pm</NBS>**

- **Laura Amendola** (CHARM) will be highlighting preliminary results from the CSER CHARM study, focused on the first 200 participants. To note, the study has found the rate of findings is consistent with previous estimates, and results from the study has direct impacts on implementing cancer risk assessment screening tools. (Abstract 822/W)
- **Shannon Rego** (P3EGS) will be presenting a few case studies from the CSER P3EGS study highlighting how the utilization of ecome sequencing in infants have lad to earlier diagnoses of well-known genetic conditions. (Abstract 582/W)


### October 17, 2019

**Poster Session, Exhibit Hall Level 1 @ George R. Brown Convention Center, <NBS>2:00pm - 3:00pm</NBS>**

- **Michelle Thompson** (SouthSeq) will be highlighting preliminary results from the CSER SouthSeq study. The study seeks to deploy genome sequencing in NICU settings to obtain early diagnosis for babies with multiple congenital anomalies, in the hope that early genetic diagnoses will improve long-term outcomes, and results from the first 106 newborns are promising. (Abstract 2527/T)
- **Jessica Rodreguez** (NYCKidSeq) will be discussing various recruitment and retention strategies the CSER NYCKidSeq study have employed to increase enrollment of participants from diverse backgrounds into the research study. Some strategies include working with a stakeholder board, translating materials into Spanish, having bilingual staff, and using continued engagement activities. (Abstract 717/T)

### October 18, 2019

**Poster Session, Exhibit Hall Level 1 @ George R. Brown Convention Center, <NBS>2:00pm - 3:00pm</NBS>**

- **Lauren Desrosiers** (KidsCanSeq) will be presenting on the CSER KidsCanSeq study's efforts to determine whether the informed consent (IC) process is impacted by working with participants from diverse populations. The study ensured that consent materials and study coordinators were available in the participant's native language. After tracking a variety of metrics, such as total time spent and number of IC attempts, the study concluded diversity had no impact IC time. (Abstract 634/F)
