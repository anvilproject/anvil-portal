- **Jessica Ezzell Hunter** (CHARM) will be giving a platform presentation on "Barriers to Knowledge of Family History and Family Communication Among LGBTQ+ Individuals in the Context of Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment". This will be part of a series of platform presentations on genetic counseling. <NBS>(5:30 - 7:00pm ET)</NBS>

**April 15, 2021 @ 10:00 - 10:10am ET (Virtual Meeting VR1)**

**April 15, 2021 @ 3:30 - 5:00pm ET (Virtual Meeting VR4)**. _Scientific Concurrent Session: Unexpected Findings Across the Lifespan: Challenges of Reporting Incidental &amp; Secondary Findings in Young Patients_

- CSER investigators **Melissa Wasserstein** (NYCKidSeq), **Kevin Bowling** (SouthSeq), and **Anna Hurst** (SouthSeq) will be giving presentations as part a scientific concurrent session on the challenges of reporting additional findings in young patients. This session is led by the CSER Sequence Analysis and Diagnostic Yield (SADY) working group, in collaboration with other investigators. This session will discuss issues with informed consent, detection, interpretation, and return of unexpected findings, and will highlight the associated challenges and burdens.
