# Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research

The precursor to the current CSER consortium was the Clinical Sequencing
Exploratory Research (CSER1) Consortium, a national multi-site research
program funded jointly by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
and National Cancer Institute (NCI), which conducted multidimensional,
translational research to evaluate the integration of genome and exome
sequencing into clinical care. Comprising of over 300 clinicians, scientists,
ethicists, bioinformaticians, economists, and legal scholars, and recruiting
over 5000 patients across diverse clinical indications, backgrounds, and age
groups, CSER1 studied the impacts and effectiveness of using genomic
sequencing in clinical care. Through this expertise and research, CSER1 has
and continues to develop and share innovations and best practices in areas
such as variant classification, return of results, additional (incidental)
findings, informed consent, and ethical, legal and social implications of
sequencing.
