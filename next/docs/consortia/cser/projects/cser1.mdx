# Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research

<p>The precursor to the current CSER consortium was the <Link
  label="Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER1) Consortium" url="https://cser1.cser-consortium.org/" />, a
  national multi-site research program funded jointly by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and
  National Cancer Institute (NCI), which conducted multidimensional, translational research to evaluate the integration
  of genome and exome sequencing into clinical care. Comprising of over 300 clinicians, scientists, ethicists,
  bioinformaticians, economists, and legal scholars, and recruiting over 5000 patients across diverse clinical
  indications, backgrounds, and age groups, CSER1 studied the impacts and effectiveness of using genomic sequencing in
  clinical care. Through this expertise and research, CSER1 has and continues to develop and share innovations and best
  practices in areas such as variant classification, return of results, additional (incidental) findings, informed
  consent, and ethical, legal and social implications of sequencing.</p>
