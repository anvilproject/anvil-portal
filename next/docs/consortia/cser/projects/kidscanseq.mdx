The Baylor College of Medicine Texas KidsCanSeq Study aims to assess the utility of genome-scale testing, compared with more targeted methods, in diverse pediatric cancer patient populations and diverse healthcare settings in Texas.

The Texas KidsCanSeq Study is building upon the previous success of the Baylor College of Medicine BASIC3 exome sequencing study to further investigate the application and utility of both germline and tumor sequencing tests in the care of childhood cancer patients. The study will compare the results of targeted cancer panel sequencing versus genome-scale testing (germline exome sequencing; tumor exome and transcriptome sequencing plus copy number array in high-risk and relapsed patients) across heterogeneous clinical settings in Texas. We will explore the clinical utility of these tests on treatment decisions (tumor testing), and the impact of diagnostic and/or actionable findings (germline testing) on cancer surveillance, genetic testing and healthcare utilization of first degree relatives. Our project, which encompasses the diverse patient population in Texas (emphasis on Hispanic individuals), will evaluate novel, culturally sensitive methods for consent and communication of complex genomic information to families and physicians.
