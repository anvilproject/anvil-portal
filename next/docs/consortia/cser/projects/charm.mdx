The CHARM (Cancer Health Assessments Reaching Many) study will assess the utility of clinical exome sequencing and how it affects care in diverse populations. Our study population includes adults at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes.

The primary objective is to implement a hereditary cancer risk assessment program in healthy 18-50 year-olds in primary care settings within a vertically integrated health delivery system (Kaiser Permanente) and a federal qualified health center (Denver Health). We will assess clinical exome sequencing implementation and interpretation, as well as tailored interactions for low health literacy including a contextualized consent process, and a modified approach to results disclosure and genetic counseling. We will also assess the clinical utility (healthcare utilization and adherence to recommended care) and personal utility of primary and additional results from clinical exome sequencing, and evaluate the ethical and policy implications of considering personal utility of genomic information decisions for health care coverage.
