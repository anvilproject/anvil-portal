<p>
  The <Link label="ClinSeq" url="https://www.genome.gov/clinseq" /> project is
  conducting genetic sequencing amongst healthy volunteers in order to study the
  impact of returning their individual genetic results and to build a resource
  for genotype-drive research.
</p>

The ClinSeq project has been enrolling participants since 2007 in order to study clinical genomic sequencing in healthy, adult volunteers. From 2012 â€“ 2017 we recruited a cohort of 500 healthy volunteers who self-identified as African, African American or Afro-Caribbean in order to diversify the ClinSeq population. Our main goals are to study the medical, technical and genetic counseling aspects of sequencing. We do this by returning individual results to our participants and evaluating them for signs of health problems or traits that we predict they may be at risk for based on their sequencing data.
