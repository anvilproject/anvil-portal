# Finding and Accessing Datasets

- [Discovering datasets]({portalURL}/data/consortia) - Datasets of interest can be discovered
  in [AnVIL’s dataset catalog]({portalURL}/data/consortia) and by reviewing
  data-focused workspaces available to you once you are logged into Terra.
- [Requesting dataset access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access) - AnVIL's open access datasets are
  accessible to all upon logging into [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces).
  To request access for datasets with access restrictions, see AnVIL's guides for requesting access
  to [Controlled Access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access#accessing-controlled-access-data)
  and [Consortium Access](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access#accessing-consortium-access-data) datasets. If
  you need help to access additional datasets, please reach out to us
  at [help@lists.anvilproject.org]({anvilHelp}).
- [Once your access is approved](/learn/accessing-data/requesting-data-access#once-your-access-is-granted) - the
  workspaces associated with your new datasets will be listed on your Terra workspaces
  tab. [Clone](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360026130851-How-to-clone-a-workspace) the workspace to begin
  working with the dataset.
