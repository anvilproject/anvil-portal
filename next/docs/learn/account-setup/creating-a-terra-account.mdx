# Creating a Terra Account

To register for a Terra account, you will need a Gmail account or another email account (an institutional email, for example) associated with a Google identity. See [Obtaining a Google Id](/learn/account-setup/obtaining-a-google-id) for instructions on creating a Google ID.

See [Set up a Terra account](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360028235911-How-to-register-for-a-Terra-account) for instructions on setting up your Terra account.

<Alert severity="warning">
  Be sure to set up your Terra Account with the same email address that you will
  use for Gen3, and Dockstore and if required your Google Cloud Account.
