# Step 3 - Prepare for Submission

<Alert icon={false} severity="info">
  <div>
    AnVIL accepts two types of data: 1) genomic object files and 2) phenotypes and metadata. Most studies are submitting both. In this step, you will organize all required data and metadata in a format compatible with AnVIL.

    Note that in addition to the data files, genomic object files require minimal metadata, some of which is generated by the AnVIL (i.e. full path to the files in AnVIL cloud storage).

</Alert>

You will submit all metadata (including phenotypic data) in a spreadsheet-like file (TSV/TXT/CSV format). To prepare data for submission, you will

- Make sure all object files conform to AnVILâ€™s naming requirements
- Generate a TSV file for each table in the data model (from Step 2)
