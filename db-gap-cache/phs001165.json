The mission of CAG is to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders.\n\nWe aim to discover genetic causes for the most prevalent diseases of childhood including asthma, autism, diabetes, epilepsy, obesity, schizophrenia, pediatric cancer, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies.\n\nThe CAG is one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs in pediatrics, and the only center at a pediatric hospital to have established a large-scale biobank of genotyped samples. \n\nThe electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network is a consortium of 9 clinical sites with EMR linked DNA biobanks, including Northwestern University and its NUgene biobank, funded by the NHGRI (National Human Genome Research Institute) to investigate the use of electronic medical record systems for genomic research. The goal of eMERGE is to conduct genome-wide association studies in approximately 100,000 individuals using EMR-derived phenotypes and DNA from linked biorepositories.\n\nUsing electronic phenotyping methods, the consortium has been and is using DNA samples from all participating sites to explore the genetic determinants of approximately 80 phenotypes, including both diseases and traits, for which the electronic phenotyping algorithms have or are being published on [PheKB.org](https://phekb.org/).\n","enrollment":[{"reference":"Group/phs001165.v1.p1-all-subjects"}],"sponsor":{"reference":"Organization/NHGRI","type":"Organization","display":"National Human Genome Research Institute"}},"search":{"mode":"match"}}],"cacheHit":false}
