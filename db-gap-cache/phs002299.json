Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients with five interim analyses; however, the trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients.\n\nThe distribution of the day 14 clinical status score (measured using a 7-category ordinal scale) was not significantly different for patients randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo.\n\nInstructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at [https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/).
