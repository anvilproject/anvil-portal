The goal of eMERGE is to conduct genome-wide association studies in approximately 19,000 individuals using EMR-derived phenotypes and DNA from linked Biorepositories. The eMERGE Network brings together researchers with a wide range of expertise in genomics, statistics, ethics, informatics, and clinical medicine from leading medical research institutions across the country. Each center participating in the consortium is uniquely situated to provide critical resources to this highly collaborative and productive network. Each site combines a biobank or study cohort with extensive genomic data and access to clinical data derived from electronic medical records. Sites are geographically dispersed and have diverse patient populations, including two sites focusing specifically on pediatrics. \n\nThe eMERGE Network is comprised of 9 sites and one coordinating center. Each site maintains its own biorepository where DNA specimens are linked to phenotypic data contained within EMRs.\n\n <ul> <p>**Children&#39;s Hospital of Pennsylvania**, PI: Hakon Hakonarson, MD, PhD \n **Children&#39;s Hospital of Pennsylvania**, PI: Hakon Hakonarson, MD, PhD  **Cincinnati Children&#39;s Medical Center with Boston Children&#39;s Hospital**, PI: John Harley, MD, PhD - CCHMC and Ingrid Holm, MD, MPH - BCH  **Geisinger Health System**, PI: David Carey, PhD and Marc Williams, MD  **Group Health Cooperative with University of Washington**, PI: Eric Larson, MD, MPH - GHC and Gail Jarvik, MD, PhD - UW  **Marshfield Clinic with Essentia Institute of Rural Health**, PI: Catherine McCarty, PhD, MPH - Essentia and Murray Brilliant, PhD - Marshfield  **Mayo Clinic**, PI: Christopher Chute, MD, DrPH and Iftikhar Kullo, MD  **Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai**, PI: Erwin Bottinger, MD  **Northwestern University**, PI: Rex Chisholm, PhD and Maureen Smith, MS  **Vanderbilt University**, PI: Dan Roden, MD  **eMERGE Coordinating Center** - Vanderbilt University, PI: Paul Harris, PhD  \nUsing electronic phenotyping methods, the consortium used DNA samples from all participating sites to explore the genetic determinants of red cell indices, white blood count (WBC) differential, diabetic retinopathy, height, serum lipid levels, specifically total cholesterol, HDL (high density lipoprotein), LDL (low density lipoprotein), and triglycerides, and autoimmune hypothyroidism as well as using the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) paradigm to replicate and discover relationships between targeted genotypes with multiple phenotypes.\n","enrollment":[{"reference":"Group/phs000948.v1.p1-all-subjects"}],"sponsor":{"reference":"Organization/NHGRI","type":"Organization","display":"National Human Genome Research Institute"}},"search":{"mode":"match"}}],"cacheHit":false}
